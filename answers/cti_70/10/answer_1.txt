To effectively select instances for labeling in an active learning setup, we must consider strategies that help in building a robust model with minimal labeled data. Hereâ€™s how I would approach the selection:

1. **Diversity in Selection**: Choose instances that are representative of the entire dataset. This means selecting instances from different subgroups or types of data available.

2. **Uncertainty Sampling**: Select instances where the model's predictions are least confident. These are typically near the decision boundary of the classifier.

3. **Error Sampling**: Include instances where the model has made errors when predictions were available. This helps in correcting the model's biases or shortcomings.

4. **Relevance of Information**: Choose instances that contain unique or rare information which could be more valuable for the model to learn from.

5. **Stratified Sampling**: If there are multiple classes or categories, ensure that samples from each category are chosen to maintain balance.

Given that there are 247 instances in the provided dataset snippets about Microsoft Exchange security vulnerabilities, and I need to choose 70 instances, I'll aim to select instances based on the above criteria. However, since I don't have current model predictions or errors (and assuming all instances are initially unlabeled without any prior selection), I will focus on diversity and relevance for this task.

The instances selected would ideally cover a variety of topics like different types of vulnerabilities, patches, impacts on various sectors, advisories from credible sources, and notable incidents or comments from industry experts.

### Selected Instances for Labeling:
To create a diverse and informative training set, I would select the following instances based on the diversity in content type and importance of the information provided in the dataset snippets:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 67, 69, 70, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79

These selections are aimed to create a balanced and informative set for the model to learn effectively.
