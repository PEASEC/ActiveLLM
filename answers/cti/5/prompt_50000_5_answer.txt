To select the most informative instances for labeling, the focus should be on diversity and representativeness of the dataset. This includes selecting instances that cover different aspects of the issue, vary in their sources and perspectives, and potentially highlight unique or uncommon viewpoints. Given the dataset focuses on Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities, instances that provide different angles—such as technical details, impact assessments, mitigation strategies, and broader cybersecurity implications—would be ideal.

Selected instances for labeling:
1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 24, 26, 29, 30, 32, 33, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 47, 49, 52, 55, 58, 60, 63, 65, 67
