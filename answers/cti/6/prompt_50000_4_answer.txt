The task of selecting instances for labeling in an active learning context involves identifying the most informative and diverse examples from the dataset. Given the dataset provided, the selection focuses on instances that offer varied and rich information regarding Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities and related cyber security issues. Here's the selection process:

Instance 0: Selected. Provides information about an emergency patch for MS Exchange Server zero-days, relevant for understanding patching responses to vulnerabilities.

Instance 1: Selected. Discusses ransomware attacks on unpatched Exchange Servers, which is crucial for understanding the consequences of unpatched vulnerabilities.

Instance 2: Not selected. While informative about Microsoft's mitigation tool, it's less directly related to the core issue of Exchange vulnerabilities.

Instance 3: Not selected. General commentary on the situation, lacks specific information about vulnerabilities or attacks.

Instance 4: Selected. Updates on Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities and associated malware activity, valuable for understanding evolving threats.

Instance 5: Selected. Provides insights into the timeline of zero-day exploit initiation, crucial for understanding the attack lifecycle.

Instance 6: Selected. Involvement of FBI and CISA in advisory capacity adds a significant dimension to the issue.

Instance 7: Selected. Information on automatic mitigation by Microsoft Defender Antivirus is essential for understanding automated defense responses.

Instance 8: Not selected. Technical details about a specific CVE detection rule, more relevant for technical analysis than broader understanding.

Instance 9: Selected. Information on opportunistic scanning activity for vulnerabilities, important for understanding the extent of targeting.
