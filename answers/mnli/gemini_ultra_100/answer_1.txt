To effectively utilize active learning for an annotation task, consider these steps:

1. Data Exploration:

Diversity: Select instances diverse in length, vocabulary, and grammatical structure. This promotes robustness in the trained model. Include short to long examples, instances with formal/informal language, variations in sentence complexity, and different syntactic structures.
Ambiguity: Prioritize instances with potential ambiguity or confusing elements. These expose weaknesses in the model and refine its decision-making. Examples could contain sarcasm, idioms, figures of speech, or complex relationships between elements.
Representativeness: Include instances typical of the larger dataset while introducing a degree of variation. This balances representativeness and challenges for the model.
2. Labeling Guidelines:

Clear Criteria: Define specific criteria for the types of data the annotator should label. Be precise about semantic or syntactic structures of interest. Providing annotators with a clear framework promotes consistency.
Granularity: Decide the level of detail required (e.g., full-sentence labeling, entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging).
Examples: Furnish annotators with labeled examples demonstrating your guidelines, aiding their understanding and reducing ambiguities.
3. Iterative Process :

Start Small: Begin with a smaller batch of diverse instances for labeling.
Analyze Results: Assess the quality of annotated data. Look for inconsistencies, misinterpretations, or lack of adherence to guidelines.
Refine & Repeat: Utilize this analysis to update guidelines, improve annotator training, or tweak your data selection if necessary. Then, continue with more labeling instances.
Here's a candidate list of 32 instances, considering potential benefit to the model:
