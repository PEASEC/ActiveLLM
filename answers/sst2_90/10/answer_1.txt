To select 90 instances for labeling from the given dataset, I would follow a strategic approach, focusing on maximizing the diversity and representativeness of the selected instances. This approach is crucial for building a robust model, especially when working with limited data. Here's the step-by-step method I would use:

1. **Assess Data Distribution**: Understand the nature and distribution of the instances. Are there themes or categories that are more prevalent?

2. **Ensure Diversity**: Select instances that cover a wide range of themes or sentiments to ensure the model can learn from a diverse set of data.

3. **Balance Between Easy and Hard Instances**: Include both straightforward and more complex or ambiguous instances to provide a balanced learning opportunity.

4. **Avoid Redundancy**: Avoid selecting instances that are too similar to each other to maximize the information gained from each instance.

5. **Incorporate Rare Cases**: If there are rare or unique instances, include some of these to ensure the model can handle edge cases.

Based on these principles, I will now select 90 instances from the provided dataset. This selection aims to cover a range of sentiments and themes, balancing straightforward and complex cases, and including unique instances when relevant.

The selected instances are: 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99.

This selection aims to create a well-rounded and diverse set of instances for the annotator to label, which should aid in the development of a robust and well-trained model.
