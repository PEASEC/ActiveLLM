4. partnership from : taiwo & partners chamber
solicitors and senior advocate
of nigeria ( san )
hello ,
i know you might be surprised to get this mail , i am barr . taiwo
martins , the personal attorney to late engr . dahlig mitchell
( director / ceo of messr ketsonwats coporation ofjapan , located in
abuja , the capital city of the federal republic of nigeria ) .
a couple of days ago , the manager of united bank for africa plc nigeria
discovered a credit balance of us $ 7 . 5 m belonging to late engr . dahlig
and in his research , he also discovered that i was the personal
attorney to the deceased . he contacted me to present the next of kin to
my late client so that his fund valued at us $ 7 . 5 m which late
engr . dahlig deposited with the bank will be transfered to him as the
legal next of kin . the bank manager went on to say that if i fail to
present the next of kin within a time limit , the bank will convert this
fund to bank treasury .
meanwhile , this foreign company has long been liquidated due to the
death of the director / ceo ( engr . dahlig ) of the company on the 6 th of
august 1997 in a plane crash ( korea flight 801 ) it is on this note that
i decided to look for a reliable over sea partner whom i can present as
the next of kin and transfer this money to his personel or company
account . since i was the personal attorney to late engr . dahlig and the
request made by the bank for me to present the next of kin to them , i
feel this is my own golden opporturnity to attain greater heights .
please inform me immediately if you can handle this transaction bearing
in mind that you will provide a safe bank account where the funds will
be transfered .
i will come over to meet you as soon as the fund is transfered to your
account for sharing which will be 50 / 50 . indicate your interest by
replying this mail . note that this transaction is completely risk free
and highly confidential . it is also legally backed up .
best regards ,

subject : re : deal # 339693 eol waha
aquila split the volume between two points , that is why the deal changed .
the total volume was still correct . i just found out today , from stacie ,
that a buy on eol needs to be on the header and come from a pgev hub or title
tracking agreement . i had previously been under the impression that
whatever pipeline the customer wanted , buy or sell , was fine with us .
however , keeping the purchases on hub agmts . will save enron
$ . 0025 / transaction and push all imbalances and fees to the supplier .

this urgent investor bulletin has been sent out to our millions of subscribers immediately to allow investors the opportunity to accumulate a substantial position in this great stock . instapay systems , inc . . ( otcbb : ipys ) is the latest new pick , set to really move in near future . this company deserves your immediate attention . stock mule team found a new winner yet again !
instapay systems , inc . , ( otcbb : ipys )
current price : $ 0 . 40
short term target : $ 1 . 20
short term gain ; 300 %
instapay systems highlights
no competition - ipys is the first and only transaction processing production system to enable internet merchants to accept atm card ( " pin " debit ) payments - this is a multibillion market currently , and the fastest growing segment of the transaction processing industry . online credit card and electronic check purchases totaled more than $ 90 billion in the us in 2003 .
merchants pay only a fixed fee per transaction for pin debit transactions , as opposed to the way credlt card transactions are currently processed , as a percentage of the dollar amount of the transactions . merchants will save billions in transaction processing fees paid to visa , mc and other credit card companies .
ipys developed the encrypted processing system enabling the use of atm cards over the internet and owns the patents to it as well as the gateway service for delivering this service over the internet .
the company has already identified several major credit card transaction processing providers that are violating the company ' s patent and ipys is filing several civil law suits to collect the tens of millions due the company by some of the biggest names in the processing business .
many large chain store merchants are opting to lower their electronic transaction processing costs by offering pin debit payment solutions to customers . in february 2004 wal - mart ( nyse : wmt ) began refusing mastercard signature debit cards and requires customers to enter their pin number , saving the chain tens of millions annually . ipys owns the patents to this process that walmart ' s processors are using .
ebay ( nasdaq : ebay ) acquisition of paypal for 1 . 5 billion tied them into direct debit processing for ebay purchases this year . direct debit processing is expected to account for 45 % of all transactions by 2005 . ipys patents will allow the company to literally own this market .
the stock mule team can ' t predict a long term target for ipys because no one knows what will happen when ipys signs its next several large nationally based chain stores to its transactions processing system . this stock could skyrocket to $ 10 . 00 overnight ; and then explode beyond our wildest dreams ! thank you for your trust and keep the faith the stock mule team

18. follow up on transport pv quantities the following table summarizes the pv quantities associated with the three transportation contracts owned by the navy yard . you may use this number to look at the impact of a 1 cent change in demand rates ( unitized ) on the value of the transaction . because pipeline demand charges do not flow as part of the sales price , an increase in the demand charge will result in a loss to the deal .
as a reminder , the base valuation makes very reasonable ( and conservative ) assumptions regarding increases in pipeline demand charges over the term of the deal .

25. asalam , dear ,
i am mrs . suha arafat , the wife of yasser arafat , the palestinian leader who died recently in paris . since his death and even prior to the announcement , i have been thrown into a state of antagonism , confusion , humiliation , frustration and hopelessness by the present leadership of the palestinian liberation organization and the new prime minister . i have even been subjected to physical and psychological torture . as a widow that is so traumatized , i have lost confidence with everybody in the country at the moment .
you must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the discovery of some fund in my husband secret bank account and companies and the allegations of some huge sums of money deposited by my husband in my name of which i have refuses to disclose or give up to the corrupt palestine government .
in fact the total sum allegedly discovered by the government so far is in the tune of about $ 6 . 5 billion dollars . and they are not relenting on their effort to make me poor for life .
i have deposited the sum of 21 million dollars with a security financial firm in whose name is withheld for now until we open communication . i shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your bank account for safe keeping and investment opportunity . this arrangement will be known to you and i alone and all our correspondence should be strictly on email alone because our government has tapped all my lines and are monitoring all my moves .
in view of the above , if you are willing to assist for our mutual benefits , we will have to negotiate on your percentage share of the $ 21 , 000 , 000 that will be kept in your position for a while pending when my daughter , zahwa , will come off age and take full responsibility of her family estate / inheritance .
please , if you are honest , i am going to entrust more funds in your care as this is one of the legacy we keep for our children . in case you don ' t accept please do not let me out to the security and international media as i am giving you this information in total trust and confidence i will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith and send to me your complete personal contact information .
may god bless you and your household .
yours sincerely ,

hi vince , paulo oleira ( one of the m . i . t attending our meeting on wed ) ' s
research interest turned out to be a match for april hodgeson ( vp of content
origination ) . i had him talk to april ( stinson was on the call as well ) to
discuss his research interest and what he would likely to do for april . i
suggested ( and april agrees ) that paulo would intern with her and matt and
perform research on how end users ( consumers and business ) improved
experience with epowered content can be quantified . this may include
performing control experiments at m . i . t . we decided not to over specify what
he would do since it is likely to change as soon as he arrives . i suggested
once he starts , he will work with april and matt harris ( vp enterprise
origination ) and they will define what the student needs to complete for the
internship .
addiontionally , tom gros agrees that this type of research are needed and
this is a great way to start .
i will proceed to have recruiting contact the student with an offer to start
around may 22 , 2000 unless someone tells me otherwise .
regards ,
ravi .
p . s . charlene , please include paulo in your may 22 , 2000 start group . paulo
will report to me within ebs research group but will work on a day - to - day
basis with april and matt . as you ' ve mentioned that compensation is somewhat
fixed but please keep in mind that this person is a phd candidate with very
specialized skill set . please contact vince before extending an offer that
may be too low , etc .

30. hello ! ! ! urgent business relationship
i am alhaji mohammed abacha , the son of the late
nigerian head of state who died on the 8 th of june
1998 while in active services .
following the sudden death of my father , general sani
abacha , the present civilian government has thrown my
family and i into a state of utter confusion ,
frustration , and hopelessness . i have been subjected to
inhuman physical and physiological torture ,
incarceration by the security agents in my country . i
was only recently released from detention after been
arraigned before the federal high court of nigeria for
an offence committed by my late father .
the incumbent civilian administration of chief
olusegun obasanjo has intensified his probe into my
late father ' s activities while in the office and he
has frozen all our local and foreign accounts together
with other assets of my family as a retaliation for
what my late father did to him when he was alive as
the head of the military regime in nigeria . as a
matter of fact , we have been declared bankrupt and
they are not relenting to make us poor for life .
as a man that is so traumatized , i have lost
confidence with anybody within my country as all those
who benefited immensely during the regime of my late
father have openly abandoned all my family .
my reasons for contacting you .
i got your contacts through my personal research and
out of desperation decided to reach you through this
medium .
you must have heard over the media reports and the
internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money
deposited by my late father in different banks and
security firms abroad . some of these banks and
security firms willingly gave - up / divulge their banking
secrets and disclosed to the present civilian
administration of chief olusegun obasanjo , all my
family ' s cash lodgement and monetary transactions with
them .
please my dear , i repose great confidence in you and i
hope you will not betray my confidence in you .
i have secretly deposited the sum of $ 20 , 000 , 000 . 00
with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for
now until we open communications . the money is
contained in a metal box consignment with security
deposit number .
i shall be grateful if you could receive this fund
into your bank account for safekeeping . this
arrangement is known to you and my junior brother
( abbas ) only . so i will deal directly with you . i am
proposing a 20 % share of the fund to you for your kind
assistance . i shall provide for you all the documents
of the fund deposit with the security firm , and raise
a power of attorney ` to enable you claim and receive
this fund into your bank account .
also this transaction demands absolute
confidentiality . on no condition must you disclose it
to anybody irrespective of your relation with the
person . remember , loose lips sinks ship
i am looking forward to your urgent and positive
response via my email .
best regards
alhaji mohammed abacha .

31. attention ! ! ! can you be honest ? from : 1002 lausanne
switzerland
dear friend .
my name is ms . lioudmila oconnor a member of independent
committee of eminent persons ( icep ) , switzerland . this committee
is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in
switzerland belonging to non - swiss indigenes , which have remained
dormant since world war ii .
it may interest you to know that in july of 1997 , the swiss banker ' s
association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by
non - swiss citizens . these accounts had been dormant since the end of
world war ii ( may 9 , 1945 ) . most belonged to holocaust victims .
the continuing efforts of the independent committee of
eminent persons have since resulted in the discovery of additional
dormant accounts - 54 , 000 in december , 1999 .
the published lists contain all types of dormant accounts , including
interest - bearing savings accounts , securities accounts , safe deposit
boxes , custody accounts , and non - interest - bearing transaction
accounts . numbered accounts are also included . interest is paid
on accounts that were interest bearing when established .
the claims resolution tribunal handles processing of all claims on
accounts due non - swiss citizens . a dormant account of ( the deceased )
with a credit balance of 21 , 000 , 000 us dollar plus
accumulated interest was discovered by me . the beneficiary was
murdered during the holocaust era , leaving no will and no possible
records for trace of heirs . the claims resolution tribunal has been
mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of
accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury
of switzerland government as provided by the law for management of
assets of deceased beneficiaries who died interstate ( living no
wills ) .
being a top executive at icep , i have all secret details and necessary
contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch . the funds will be
banked in a safe haven and we can share the funds and use in
investment of our choice . due to the sensitive nature of my job , i
need a foreigner to help claim the funds .
all that is required is for you to provide me with your details for
processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents
for transfer of the funds to you , to this regard , you are expected to
fill out a text form . i will pay all required fees to ensure
that the fund is transferred to a secured , numbered account in your
name , where you will be capable of accessing the funds and gradually
transfering to your country and other
banks of choice in the world . there is no risk involved .
you can find additional information about unclaimed funds through the
internet at the following websites :
www . swissbankclaims . com
www . wiesenthal . com
the holocaust claims processing office has put funds in escrow
awaiting submission of valid claims for necessary disbursement .
i find myself priviledged to have this information and this may be a
great opportunity for a life time of success without risks . due to
confidential reasons , reply via email only . you may reply to me
securely through this email address ( lioudmila . lioumila @ gmx . net )
i await your urgent response to this proposal via my email address .
thank you for your prompt response .
my regards
kimaeva lioudmila

the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 have
changed
the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and
logica |
security have become paramount for ail industry segments , especiaily in
the
banking , nationa | resource and government sectors . according to giga ,
a
whoily owned subsidiary of forrester research , woridwide demand for
information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by
2 oo 5 .
homeland security investments is a newsietter dedicated to providing
our
readers with information pertaining to investment opportunities in this
lucrative sector . as we know , events related to homeiand security
happen
with | ightning speed . what we as investors can do is position
ourselves in
such a way as to take advantage of the current trends and be ready to
capitaiize on events which have yet to happen . homeiand security
investments is here to help our readers do just that .
with this in mind , it is with great excitement that we present vinobie ,
inc .

* * * why we beiieve vnbl . ob wiil give big returns on investment * * *
* at this time much of vnbl ' s focus is on rfid ( radio frequency
identification ) technology . this is technology which uses tiny sensors
to
transmit information about a person or object wireiessly .
* vnbl is aiready an industry pioneer in the rfid persona | location
technology .
* vnbl is deveioping a form of rfid technology which aliows companies
and
governments to wirelessiy track their assets and resources . such
technoiogy
has huge potentia | in the protection and transportation of materiais
designated " high risk " were they to fall into the wrong hands .
* vnbl works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order
to
create " high security space " in | ocaies where it is deemed necessary .
locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports , sea
ports ,
mines , nuclear faciiities , and more .
* as with a | | stocks , news drives the short term price . fresh news has
made vnbl a hot buy .
news on vnbl
malibu , caiif . - - ( business wire ) - - june 16 , 20 o 5 - - vinoble , inc .
( otcbb : vnbl -
news ) , a hoiding company seeking to identify | ong - term growth
opportunities
in the areas of homeiand security , security information systems , and
other
security services , announced today that it pians to offer products and
services that will assist in the automation of the identification and
contro | of equipment , assets , toois , and the reiated processes used in
the
oi | & gas and petrochemical industries .
aithough smail wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines
and
equipment to detect possibie probiems before they become serious , they
can
also deiiver safety features within oi | we | | s . oil maybe trapped in
different | ayers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of
specific
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,
such as
a wel | filiing with water .
as with other rf based technoiogy applications , rfid can also provide
the
safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler , and | imit the
entry of personne | to specific | ocations . ensuring personne | safety is
essential , shouid there be an emergency at a facility , rfid tags wouid
enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee ' s safety and / or
danger . this application technoiogy requires product and hardware that
can
operate in harsh and potentiaily hazardous conditions , but gives
vaiuable
safety to the resources and assets that are vita | to the customer . rfid
can
also assist the customer ' s supply chain by tracking oil , gas , and
chemica |
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level .
vinoble ' s viewpoint as previousiy stated is that these applications are
more
than just a vaiuabie too | to the mining industry , but as a protective
measure of our country ' s natura | resources and commodities against
threat .
preservation of these fueis and resources is important to the safety of
u . s .
industry and economy .
the company beiieves that such offering service and technology
appiication
in the oil & gas and petrochemical industry will further position
vinoble in
a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the
increasing capital and globa | spending that the company wil | require
for
growth . the company ' s goal is to aiso provide a much - needed service at
a
cost manageable to even the smaliest of businesses that can ' t afford to
do
without the safety of its personne | and assets in this current state of
constant threat .
this is outstanding news . the growth potential for this company is
exceptional . in an aiready hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truly
innovative pioneer . we see big things happening to this stock .

subject : jacob feedback
i asked jacob two questions to check his basic knowledge . he answered correctly in the optimization question so i believe that he has a good foundation on his optimization skill . i have a doubt about his stochastic skill because he took only one course in stochastic processes and his previous models are simple deterministic models . if we had more interview time i would be able to check his stochastic and modeling skills .
he completely failed to answer the second question , which is to check his basic risk management skill . it is clear to me that he has a very weak background in finance and risk management . he does not understand the relationship between a discount rate and risk . he showed some weakness in annuity calculation .
in conclusion , i feel that he has good basic in optimization but a very weak background in finance . based on his experiences , i have a doubt on his advance optimization skills , such as his stochastic skill and his ability to attack a complex optimization problem . i would recommend a second - round interview if he will be solving a complex - optimization problem .

59. re : tom halliburton dear all :
a few words about tom . he is a power engineer type who has previously worked
at northwestern us and new zealand utilities on various projects including
asset planning and hydro scheduling . he was hired by ei structuring to
oversee modeling efforts using sddp , henwood , etc . because of the recent
implosion at ei apache , tom ' s group has effectively evaporated , and thus he
is looking for a new home . he has some finance background from having to
do asset evaluation for utility rate filings . he has almost no options
experience . he seems to have quite a bit of experience in some classes of or
problems .
clearly the most obvious fit is with my group , but the idea is for you all to
see if tom has a tool set that may be of use to other research projects .
and , as usual , the personality fit is the other aspect to examine .
this is meant to be casual . if the consensus is positive , then i will explore
the formalities of such a transfer .
thanks ,
grant . [ID: 465]

65. traders daily report best stoc - k for year 2005 - read the story and you will see for yourself
are you tired of public companies without anything substantial backing their story - how about a revolutionary invention that will change the security industry forever , and the company just went public ! ! !
company name : sniffex inc
ticker : snfx
we profiled this stoc - k 1 month ago when it was at $ 1 and we said dont buy unless you are long term player , we projected $ 5 - 10 should be seen soon and since then the stoc - k went to $ 3 . 4 high and is now steadily trading like $ 500 k or more every day at $ 2 . 80 range .
the company has the most sensitive explosive detection device in the world and now after what happened in london 10 days ago this sector is the hottest on the stoc - k market .
we believe sniffex will start selling their devices very soon to all security forces around the world simply because their device can find even 100 grams of almost any type of explosive from 30 - 50 yards maybe even more and even through walls or metal shield .
we strongly believe once everybody on the stoc - k market realize what a gem snfx then its possible for this stoc - k to see $ 10 - 20 levels .
rating : strong buy
industry : security , homeland security , cargo screening and explosion detection systems
recent news : sniffex , inc . announces international marketing program
do not buy this stoc - k if you want to just play it for a few days , this issue will bring best returns only for long term investors who realize the potential of the company and the fact that 2 - 3 contracts on government level could skyrocket the stoc - k price above $ 10 - 20 .
reason for the top 2005 rating : unique explosive detection device capable of finding its targets from tens or hundreds of meters ! ! ! there is no other eds device which is so powerful that can locate almost any explosive behind concrete walls from distance of tens of meters ! !
the competition : there are many companies in the industry of sniffing explosives , some of them are public and they are companies like ison hwpr or hiet and all of them have devices which can locate explosive from 10 inches , 1 feet , 2 feet or close to that .
compared to these results sn fx device is tens of times better and smaller in size and yet cheaper ! !
snfx announced the release of sniffex version 1 . 1 , a handheld explosives detection device which the company claims can locate nitro - based explosives from a distance of 10 to 100 feet depending on the quantity of the explosive and environmental conditions .
the company also stated that , to the best of their knowledge , sniffex is the first device of its kind that can operate from such distances and find exp losives behind barriers .
could this company be amongst the top deals on wallstreet this year ! ! ! yes its trading at only $ 2 . 8 now and this brand new stoc - k could be $ 10 - 20 easily in the next few months as the story unfolds ! !
do not buy this stoc - k if you want to just play it for a few days , this issue will bring best returns only for long term investors who realize the potential of the company and the fact that 2 - 3 contracts on government level could skyrocket the stoc - k price above $ 10 .
snfx is in process of presenting the new device in usa and to worldwide markets and as soon as they receive some substantial orders and feedback from big institutional clients , this stoc - k will fly in the skies ,
as an example ison traded almost 1 billion dollars after they announced they are in process of developing some device , and snfx already has the device and it proved it works in numerous tests ! !
recent news announcement from the company : sniffex , inc . ( snfx ) ( sniffex ) , producers of sniffex , an explosive detection device , announced today the results of a new international marketing campaign that includes asia , australia , and the middle east .
the company stated that inquires for the product has come from at least 10 countries and that discussions have already begun on distribution agreements in several of those countries .
the company further stated that they have had significant direct interest from us government agencies and several foreign governments .
our progress as a new company has been steadily accelerating . the events of july 7 , 2005 in london have further increased the interest in sniffex and in our company ' s future products .
we believe we are at the forefront of providing new tools for effectively fighting the international war on terror , stated paul johnson , president of sniffex , inc . we are saddened by the losses that occurred in london and we are hopeful that sniffex will become a critical component in saving future lives .
this stoc - k is going to be the hottest issue for the year 2005 ! !

i have recently come on board as treasurer , enron india . prior to joining ,
i was with reliance industries , a petrochemical conglomerate in india .
the central banking authorities are now thinking of permitting

industry standard . would it be possible to arrange for two copies to be sent

institution here worth fourteen million five hundred thousand united states dollars ( 14 , 500 , 000 ) .
as his personal attorney and since i am the only one who knows about the deposit , i went to the financial institution to make the claim and was told that the only person who can claim this money is his next of kin .
since all his family died at the accident , all effort to trace his next of kin proved abortive . therefore , i am writing to you so that i can make you the deceased next of kin , as the security company also told me that immediatelyi present the deceased next of kin , the money would be released
to the person within few working days . be informed that your gratification for assistingme to claim this money shall be 50 % ; while the remaining 50 % shall be
mine .
in my next e - mail , i shall give you detail explanation on how the project will be executed . meanwhile , acknowledge the receipt of this mail immediately and include your personal and direct telephone / fax numbers for easy communication .

97. california assembly releases " modified mou " for edison please forward to others who need this information .
as you know , enron ' s been involved with a group of business customers , small customers , labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core / noncore proposal that would act as a key modification to edison ' s mou with the governor .
today , the assembly leadership released a bill ( ab 82 xx ) that modifies the mou but does not follow the core / noncore proposal negotiated by the group . the bill just came out , is about 80 pages long , and thorough analysis has not yet been completed . the url for the bill is attached . based on a meeting attended this morning in sacramento , the key features of the bill ( which is attached ) are :
direct access suspended until 1 . 1 . 2003 ( suspension presumably effective on the effective date of the bill )
transmission sale at 2 x book .
approximately 90 % ( or greater ) of edison ' s undercollection absorbed by customers 20 kw and above .
create a trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the generators 70 cents on the dollar ( but does not do away with the suits , investigations , etc . )
the bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the dwr contracts and what the payment structure will look like .
reaction and timetable
very chaotic , with considerable uncertainty about where ( if anywhere ) the bill will go , leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong possibility .
business customers ( and of course enron ) are strongly opposed
republicans are strongly opposed
labor has big problems with the tx sale unless they get assurances that tx labor jobs are guaranteed , which is not yet included in the bill
we are working with business to remove the direct access suspension
we are also working on the senate side to attempt to get the senate to include direct access in their version of the modified mou , but the senate has been more hostile than the assembly to direct access .
senate democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds to repay general fund for power already purchased from the dwr contracts . ab 82 xx does not address this issue .
senate democrats also intend to craft their own version of a " modified mou . " word is that the senate will release their bond language and their " modified " mou this weekend or early next week .
the assembly will hold an " informational " hearing on the bill tomorrow ( saturday ) to get members up to speed
the assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on monday , with the intent of sending the bill to the full assembly for a vote on tuesday .
the legsilature is supposed to have a month - long recess beginning friday , july 20 th , which requires that both the budget and the energy issue get resolved by then , or suspend the recess and continue working
will continue to provide updates as events unfold . if folks have additional comments on the bill , please direct them to harry kingerski and leslie lawner , who will ensure that they get into the hands of our lobbyists in sacramento .
if there are any questions , my pager is 888 . 916 . 7184 .
best ,
jeff
