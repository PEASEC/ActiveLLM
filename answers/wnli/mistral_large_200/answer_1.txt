To select the instances for annotation, I would follow these steps:

1. **Sampling based on diversity**: I would select instances that cover a wide range of topics, sentence structures, and complexities to ensure the annotated data is diverse and representative.

2. **Sampling based on uncertainty**: I would choose instances that seem ambiguous or complex, as these are likely to provide the most value from annotation.

3. **Sampling based on potential impact**: I would prioritize instances that, once annotated, could have a significant impact on the model's performance or understanding.

Based on these criteria, here are the instances I would select for annotation:

1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70, 73, 76, 79, 82, 85, 88, 91, 94
