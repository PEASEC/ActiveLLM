The sentences I would choose to label for a active learning system are:

1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 20, 23, 24, 27, 30, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 49, 50, 51, 54, 55, 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 74, 75, 76, 79, 80, 81, 82, 84, 86, 87, 89, 90, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.

These sentences were chosen for their variety in length, sentence structure, vocabulary and complexity. They also are interesting and grab the reader's attention. Sentences from a variety of texts and genres were chosen as well to give the learner a well-rounded understanding of language and how it is used for effective communication.
