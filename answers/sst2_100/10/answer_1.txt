To select the most informative instances for labeling by a human annotator in an active learning context, the following steps would be taken:

1. **Understand the Goal:** Determine the specific task or problem that the dataset is intended to solve (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic classification). This understanding guides the selection of instances.

2. **Initial Assessment:** Quickly assess the given instances to understand their diversity, complexity, and the range of topics or sentiments they cover.

3. **Diversity and Representativeness:** Select instances that represent the diversity of the dataset. This includes different topics, sentiments, writing styles, and complexities.

4. **Uncertainty Sampling:** Choose instances where the model is most uncertain about its predictions. These are typically the instances where the model's confidence in its prediction is lowest, indicating that labeling these instances could provide the most information for model improvement.

5. **Edge Cases and Ambiguities:** Identify and include instances that present ambiguities or are potential edge cases. Labeling such instances can help in fine-tuning the model's understanding of complex scenarios.

6. **Avoid Redundancy:** Avoid selecting instances that are too similar to each other to ensure that the labeling effort adds new information.

Based on this approach, I would select the following instances from the provided list. These selections aim to cover a range of sentiments, styles, and complexities, focusing on instances that could provide the most value in terms of learning and model improvement:
