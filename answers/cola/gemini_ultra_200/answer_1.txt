To select instances for an active learning annotator, I'd focus on a diverse mix with these strategies:

Understanding the Task:

What is the annotation goal? (e.g., part-of-speech tagging, entity recognition, sentiment analysis) Understanding this guides the focus.
Are there instructions or guidelines? These would determine which instances are particularly "good" or "bad" examples.
Diversity of Instances:

Cover different sentence structures: Simple, complex, compound, interrogative, declarative, etc.
Include variations in word order and syntax: This tests the model's adaptability.
Range of vocabulary and word usage: Common and uncommon words, synonyms, antonyms, polysemy (words with multiple meanings)
Different levels of ambiguity: Include both clear-cut and potentially confusing examples.
Targeting Challenging Areas:

Edge cases: Instances that might lie on the boundary of different labels or are open to interpretation.
Rare phenomena: Syntactic constructs or words that appear infrequently in the data.
Potential ambiguity sources: Homophones, negations, sarcasm, idioms, etc.
Active Learning Considerations:

Model Uncertainty: Prioritize instances where the current model is likely to be wrong or unsure.
Informativeness: Choose instances that will significantly improve the model's understanding.
Here's a possible selection strategy with examples, assuming I have a general purpose annotation task:

Base Cases: Begin with basic sentence structures.  10-15 instances to cover the fundamentals:

"Mary expected John to fix the computer." (11)
"Did you eat?" (Modified version of 81- More basic)
"Who did you give pictures of?" (23 â€“ Wh-movement )
Variations: Introduce minor changes to test understanding of core concepts **(~5 instances):

"The lions ate the meat quickly." (32: change in word order from earlier basic example)
"Mary has more friends than Peter." (40: Comparison structures)
"Is Mary eating tuna?" (82: Variation on previous "Did you eat" example)
Uncertainty: Hypothetical model "weaknesses" to focus on (~5 instances):

"John inquired which book he should read." (31: Potential ambiguity with indirect questions)
"Did John eat or did Mary?" (Modified: adds disjunction, more complicated structure)
"I didn't give Jack a picture of himself." (147: Negation & reflexives)
Edge Cases and Rarities:  Target challenging scenarios. (~5 instances):

"I doubt that Dana believes I think Rosie loves magazine ads." (36)
"Some disgruntled old pigs in those ditches love truffles" (85: Complex noun phrases with modifiers)
"Syntax is easy to pretend that you can teach. (93: self-embedding)
Important Notes:

Iteration: This would be part of an iterative process where the model is repeatedly re-trained, and I continually analyze its weaknesses to choose a new "batch" of instances.
Task Specificity: Specific tasks would strongly influence the choice of instances.
Given List (with IDs):

I would likely recommend these, but more context on the annotation task is needed for true certainty:

11, 14, 23, 31, 32, 35, 36, 40, 47, 53, 55, 63, 66, 82, 85, 93, 94, 97, 105, 109, 119, 125, 144, 145, 147, 155, 163, 170, 180,  185, 194

One more please
Absolutely! Here's one more instance I'd consider adding to the list, along with my rationale:

Instance:
*  "It was to the student that the teacher gave the best advice." (41)

Rationale:

Passive voice: Tests the model's understanding of how grammatical roles change in passive constructions.
Prepositional phrases: Features a prepositional phrase ("to the student") modifying the word it receives its meaning from ("gave").
Semantic ambiguity: Even though grammatically correct, this sentence might initially cause a human annotator to hesitate due to its less typical word order. This potential for confusion in interpretation makes it a valuable training example.
Let me know if you'd like more! Or, if you share the specifics of your annotation task, I can tailor suggestions even better.
