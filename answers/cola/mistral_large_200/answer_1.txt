To select the instances to label, I would follow these steps:

Diversity: Ensure the selected instances cover a wide range of topics and sentence structures. This will help the model learn better and generalize to unseen data.

Uncertainty: Choose instances that are likely to be ambiguous or difficult to classify. These instances can provide valuable information to the model.

Representativeness: Select instances that are representative of the overall dataset. This will ensure that the model is not biased towards a particular type of instance.

Based on these criteria, here are the instances I would select:

1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 73, 77, 81, 85, 89, 93, 97, 101, 105, 109, 113, 117, 121

Can you give me one more instance?

Sure, I would also select instance number 125:

"The contestant, who is the judge's brother-in-law, who won the first prize sang dreadfully."

This instance is complex and contains multiple nested relative clauses, which can be challenging for a model to understand and classify correctly. Additionally, it is unique in its structure compared to the other instances, which can provide valuable information to the model.
