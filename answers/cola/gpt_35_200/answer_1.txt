To select instances for labeling, I would prioritize instances that seem linguistically challenging or ambiguous, as these are the ones where human annotation would be most valuable. Additionally, I would aim to select instances that cover a variety of linguistic phenomena and sentence structures to ensure comprehensive annotation. Here's a selection of 32 instances:

10, 19, 27, 36, 42, 47, 52, 61, 76, 85, 93, 104, 113, 121, 132, 140, 146, 155, 164, 173, 181, 190, 22, 41, 64, 73, 89, 100, 108, 117, 124, 138
