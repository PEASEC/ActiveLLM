To select the instances to label, I would follow these steps:

Identify unique named entities and relationships: I would scan through the instances and identify named entities and relationships between them. This would help me select instances that have a variety of relationships and entities.

Cover all possible relationships: I would ensure that I have instances that cover various types of relationships like possession, action, location, etc.

Cover positive and negative instances: I would select an equal number of positive and negative instances for a clearer understanding.

Ensure diversity: I would make sure that the selected instances represent the diversity of the entire dataset, covering various topics, entities, and relationships.

Based on these criteria, I would label the following instances (assuming positive instances are those with clear relationships or actions):

0, 4, 5, 16, 17, 21, 24, 25, 26, 29, 33, 37, 40, 42, 46, 49, 57, 58, 59, 62, 64, 65, 70, 71, 79, 80, 85, 87, 94, 97, 100

This list contains a diverse set of instances with various relationships, entities, and topics. It includes both simple (e.g., "He has not eaten yet today") and complex instances (e.g., "I showed few boys any of the books.") to provide a comprehensive overview for the annotator.

Can you give me one more instance?

Here's an additional instance that can be included:

If three relatives of mine die, I will inherit a house. [ID: 1037]
This instance introduces a conditional relationship and involves the concept of inheritance, contributing to the diversity of relationships and topics in the selected instances. The annotator can benefit from understanding conditional relationships, helping them identify and label such instances in the future.
