To select the 32 instances for labeling, I will apply the following steps:

1. **Variety and Diversity**: Ensure a mix of different types of sentences (declarative, interrogative, exclamatory, imperative) to cover various linguistic constructs.
2. **Complexity**: Include sentences with varying complexity, including simple, compound, and complex sentences.
3. **Common Errors**: Identify sentences with potential grammatical or syntactic errors to help the annotator focus on difficult cases.
4. **Coverage of Different Phrases**: Ensure different grammatical structures and phrases (e.g., noun phrases, verb phrases, prepositional phrases) are covered.
5. **Ambiguity**: Include sentences that might be ambiguous or tricky in terms of syntax or semantics.

Based on these criteria, here are the selected instances for labeling:

1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30, 33, 34, 36, 39, 46, 49, 53, 56, 61, 63, 66, 75, 79

These sentences cover a range of linguistic structures, potential error cases, and varying complexity.
