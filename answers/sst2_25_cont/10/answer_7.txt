To select the most informative instances for labeling by a human annotator in an active learning setting, I would follow these steps:

1. **Analyzing Already Labeled Instances**: Review the labeled instances to understand the variety of data already labeled. This includes understanding the themes, complexity, and diversity of the instances.

2. **Identifying Gaps in Labeled Data**: Look for patterns, themes, or types of instances that are underrepresented in the labeled dataset.

3. **Selecting Diverse and Representative Instances**: From the new set of instances, select those that fill the identified gaps. This could include instances that are different in tone, subject matter, complexity, or style compared to the already labeled set.

4. **Balancing Difficulty and Learning Potential**: Choose instances that are challenging but not too ambiguous. Extremely easy or clear-cut instances might not provide as much learning value, while very ambiguous instances might lead to inconsistent labeling.

5. **Diversity in Selection**: Ensure that the selected instances cover a broad spectrum of the data, representing different styles, themes, and complexities.

Now, let's apply this methodology to the provided instances.

### Analysis of Already Labeled Instances
- The labeled instances seem to cover a wide range of themes and tones, predominantly related to movie reviews. They vary from positive to negative critiques, and include different styles of expression.

### Identifying Gaps
- It seems that the labeled data covers a broad spectrum of movie critiques. However, I would look for unique or underrepresented expressions, themes, or styles in the new set of instances.

### Selecting Instances
Based on the above steps, I will now select 25 instances from the new dataset that I believe would add the most value to the labeling process:

622, 625, 629, 633, 636, 641, 647, 653, 658, 661, 667, 670, 672, 678, 681, 687, 694, 699, 707, 713, 718, 725, 732, 739, 748

These instances were selected to provide a diverse range of expressions, themes, and styles, which should enrich the labeled dataset and improve the learning outcomes of the model.
