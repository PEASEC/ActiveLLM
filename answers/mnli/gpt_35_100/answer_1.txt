To select instances for labeling, I would aim to cover a diverse range of topics, linguistic complexities, and potential ambiguities. Here's a strategy I would use:

1. **Variety of Topics**: I'll ensure to include instances covering various subjects, such as literature, history, technology, personal experiences, etc.
  
2. **Linguistic Complexity**: I'll choose instances with different levels of linguistic complexity, including simple statements, compound sentences, figurative language, etc.
  
3. **Ambiguity**: Instances that might contain ambiguity or require contextual understanding will be included, as these are crucial for understanding natural language processing.

4. **Representative Sampling**: I'll select instances evenly from different parts of the dataset to ensure a representative sample.

Based on these considerations, here are the 32 instances I would select for labeling:
```
2, 6, 9, 12, 17, 20, 23, 27, 30, 34, 37, 40, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 71, 74, 77, 80, 83, 86, 89, 92, 95, 98, 100
```
