Sure, here are the indices of the 32 instances of premises that I identified:

0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37

So, the indices of the 32 instances of premises are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37.

Are those 32 instances?

I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. I made an error in my counting and only identified 31 instances of premises instead of 32. Here are the corrected indices for the 32 instances of premises:

0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39

So, the indices of the 32 instances of premises are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39.

I apologize for any confusion my previous response may have caused.
