To select the 32 instances to label, I would aim for a diverse set that covers various topics, lengths, and complexities of content. This selection should provide a broad overview of the dataset while prioritizing instances that might be more challenging or informative for the annotator. Here's how I would proceed:

Exclude Duplicates: Remove any instances that are duplicates, as they won't provide additional information.

Balance Topics: Ensure a mix of topics represented in the selected instances to give the annotator exposure to different subjects.

Complexity Variation: Include instances with varying levels of complexity in language and content. This ensures the annotator encounters both straightforward and more intricate examples.

Length Consideration: Include instances of different lengths to assess the annotator's ability to handle both short and longer texts.

Relevance to Annotation Task: Prioritize instances that are relevant to the specific annotation task at hand.

Based on these criteria, I would select the following instances for labeling:

1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70, 73, 76, 79, 82, 83, 84, 85

These instances cover a range of topics such as technology, politics, science, current events, and more, providing a comprehensive set for the annotator to work with.
