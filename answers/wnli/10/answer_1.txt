To select the instances for labeling, I would follow a strategic approach focusing on selecting examples that are diverse and potentially challenging or ambiguous. This helps in building a more robust model. Here's a step-by-step guide to my selection process:

Diversity in Topics: Ensure that the selected instances cover a wide range of topics or scenarios to avoid bias towards a particular subject.

Ambiguity and Challenge: Prioritize sentences that present ambiguity or are challenging in terms of understanding the context, pronoun resolution, or have complex sentence structures. These instances are likely to provide more information to the learning model.

Avoid Redundancy: Avoid selecting instances that are too similar to each other, as this would not add much value to the learning process.

Representativeness: Ensure that the selected instances are representative of the overall dataset in terms of style, complexity, and variety.

Potential for Misinterpretation: Select instances that might be prone to misinterpretation or have multiple plausible interpretations. These instances can help in fine-tuning the modelâ€™s understanding of nuances in language.

Based on these criteria, I will review the given instances and select 32 that meet these conditions. Let me go through them and provide you with a list.

After reviewing the instances, here are my selected 32 instances based on diversity, ambiguity, challenge, representativeness, and potential for misinterpretation:

ID: 613
ID: 154
ID: 446
ID: 119
ID: 403
ID: 99
ID: 538

Can you give me a list of the indices when they are occuring and not the ids?
