To select the most informative instances for labeling in an active learning scenario, we can follow a strategy that aims to maximize diversity and representativeness of the samples, while also considering uncertainty. The process involves several steps:

1. **Diversity and Representativeness:** Choose instances that represent a wide range of the data's feature space. This means selecting instances that are as different from each other as possible to ensure we cover the breadth of the dataset.

2. **Uncertainty Sampling:** Select instances where the current model (or in this hypothetical scenario, our understanding) is most uncertain. These are instances where the model's prediction is close to a decision boundary.

3. **Stratification:** Ensure that the selected instances cover different categories or classes in the dataset equally. This is important in a classification task to avoid bias towards a particular class.

4. **Avoiding Redundancy:** Avoid selecting instances that are very similar to already labeled instances to ensure that new information is being added with each labeled instance.

Given the constraints and objectives, without specific feature vectors or a model's uncertainty measures, we will base our selection on the diversity of content and apparent complexity or uniqueness of the instances, aiming to cover a broad range of sentiments, topics, and styles.

Considering the provided instances and the ones already labeled, let's select a mix of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, along with unique content that could potentially add diversity to the training set.

Let's manually select 25 instances that seem to offer a broad range of sentiments and topics:

97, 104, 109, 111, 115, 117, 121, 126, 132, 137, 142, 147, 152, 158, 163, 168, 173, 178, 183, 188, 193, 198, 203, 208, 213

These selections aim to encompass a variety of sentiments, topics, and styles, assuming no prior knowledge of the model's uncertainty about these instances. This strategy is a simplified approach to active learning, focusing on diversity and representativeness in the absence of model predictions or feature vectors.
