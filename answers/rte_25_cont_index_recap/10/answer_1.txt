To select instances for labeling in an active learning setup, you would ideally want to choose those that are most informative for the model you are training. Here's a step-by-step approach you might consider:

1. **Uncertainty Sampling**: Select instances where the current model is most uncertain. This typically means choosing examples closest to the decision boundary of a classifier.

2. **Diversity**: Ensure the selected instances are diverse and cover different aspects or features of the data. This helps the model learn a wide range of patterns.

3. **Representativeness**: Choose instances that are representative of the overall dataset. This helps in maintaining the generalization capability of the model.

4. **Error Analysis**: Optionally, look at instances where the model currently makes errors, if such information is available, to specifically target weaknesses in the model.

Given the nature of the dataset provided (each instance contains two sentences with an implied or explicit relationship, and an identifier), I would focus on choosing instances that likely represent diverse scenarios and relationships, as well as those where the relationship might be more complex or nuanced, thus providing a rich signal for learning.

Based on this approach, here are the instances I would select for labeling, taking into account the need for diversity, uncertainty, and representativeness:

0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 20, 23, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34, 35, 36, 39

These instances include a range of different contexts and complexities, such as legal issues, technology, historical events, and personal statements, which should provide a rich set of data points for model training under an active learning framework.
