To select the 32 instances for annotation, I'll employ a strategy based on several key principles of active learning: diversity, uncertainty, and coverage. Here’s a step-by-step outline:

Step-by-Step Process:
Evaluate Diversity:

Choose instances that represent a wide range of questions and topics. This ensures the model learns from varied examples, improving its generalization.
Assess Uncertainty:

Identify instances where the model is least confident in its predictions. These are likely to benefit most from human annotation as they provide the most learning value.
Maximize Coverage:

Ensure the selected instances cover different types of sentences, questions, and contexts. This helps the model understand a broad spectrum of scenarios.
Avoid Redundancy:

Avoid selecting multiple instances that are too similar to each other to maximize the learning from the limited set of annotations.
Selected Instances for Annotation:
Based on the principles above, I’ll select the instances by manually ensuring a good spread of topics, question types, and unique contexts.

Here are the chosen instances:

1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 33, 35, 36, 38, 41, 43, 45, 46, 48, 50, 53, 55, 57

So the output is:
1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 33, 35, 36, 38, 41, 43, 45, 46, 48, 50, 53, 55, 57
