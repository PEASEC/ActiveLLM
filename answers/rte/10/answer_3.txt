To select the most informative instances for labeling by a human annotator in an active learning scenario, the primary goal is to choose examples that will most improve the model's performance. This often involves selecting instances that are challenging, diverse, and representative of the dataset. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Assessment**: Review the dataset to understand its diversity, structure, and type of information it contains. This helps in identifying key features and potential challenges.

2. **Diversity and Representativeness**: Ensure that the selected instances cover a wide range of the dataset's features. This avoids bias and improves the model's ability to generalize.

3. **Difficulty or Uncertainty**: Prefer instances where the model's current performance is poor or uncertain. These instances often provide the most information when labeled correctly.

4. **Avoid Redundancy**: Avoid selecting instances that are very similar to each other or to already labeled instances.

5. **Balanced Selection**: If the dataset has categories or classes, ensure that the selection is not heavily skewed towards a particular category unless it's intentional.

6. **Practical Considerations**: Consider the practicality of annotation. Some instances may be too complex or ambiguous, making them difficult for annotators to label accurately.

Based on these principles, the selection from the given instances would focus on finding a mix of sentences that are diverse in content, potentially challenging in terms of ambiguity or complexity, and representative of different types of information in the dataset.

Given the nature of the instances, which seem to involve sentence comparisons or information extraction tasks, I would select a mix of instances that show varying degrees of similarity or difference between the sentences, and cover a range of topics. This would include instances with clear contradictions, subtle differences, and those that require contextual or specialized knowledge.

Considering these criteria and the provided instances, a potential selection could be (this is an example and might vary based on further analysis of the dataset and the model's current performance):

0, 3, 4, 6, 10, 13, 16, 21, 24, 27, 31, 34, 36, 43, 48, 50, 53, 57, 61, 67, 72, 76, 80, 87, 91, 96, 100, 106, 110, 116, 121, 127.

This selection tries to cover a range of topics and difficulty levels, from straightforward comparisons to more nuanced ones, and includes instances that might challenge the model's current understanding.
