To select the instances to label, I would consider the diversity of the examples, their complexity, and the level of uncertainty or ambiguity they present. This would help to train a model that can generalize well to a variety of instances and handle difficult cases. Here are the 32 instances I would choose:

0, 3, 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 20, 22, 23, 27, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69

These instances cover a range of topics, include both simple and complex sentences, and present a variety of relationships between the premise and the hypothesis.
