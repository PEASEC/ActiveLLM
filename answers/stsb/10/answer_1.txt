To effectively select 32 instances for labeling by a human annotator from the given dataset, I would use a strategy that aims to balance diversity and representativeness, focusing on instances that are challenging, informative, or ambiguous. This approach helps in creating a well-rounded dataset that can improve the learning of a model. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify Clear vs. Ambiguous Instances**: Differentiate between instances where the sentences are clearly similar or different and those where there's ambiguity. Ambiguous instances are more informative for training.

2. **Balance Topics and Categories**: Ensure that the selected instances cover a range of topics and categories to avoid bias and ensure representativeness.

3. **Include Challenging Cases**: Select instances that represent edge cases or challenging scenarios, as they can provide valuable insights and improve the robustness of the model.

4. **Avoid Redundancy**: Avoid selecting instances that are too similar to each other to ensure a diverse set of data points.

5. **Consider Linguistic Variability**: Include instances that show a variety of linguistic expressions, as this can help in understanding different ways of conveying similar or different meanings.

Following this approach, I have selected the following instances for labeling:

0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 17, 19, 21, 24, 27, 30, 32, 35, 38, 41, 42, 45, 50, 53, 56, 60, 66, 68, 71, 75, 79, 82, 87, 90, 95, 99

These instances offer a mix of clarity, ambiguity, thematic diversity, and linguistic variation, making them ideal for a rich and informative annotation process.
