To select the 25 most informative instances for labeling, I will consider the principles of active learning, which focus on choosing instances that are likely to be most beneficial for the learning process. The goal is to pick instances that are challenging, diverse, and representative of the dataset. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Diversity in Content**: Ensure that the selected instances cover a wide range of topics, styles, and sentiments. This helps the model learn from a variety of instances.

2. **Uncertainty Sampling**: Prioritize instances that the current model is most uncertain about. Since I don't have model predictions, I'll infer uncertainty based on the complexity or ambiguity of the text.

3. **Representativeness**: Choose instances that seem representative of the dataset as a whole. This includes common themes or styles that appear frequently in the dataset.

4. **Avoid Redundancy**: Avoid selecting instances that are too similar to already labeled ones.

5. **Complexity and Nuance**: Prefer instances that have complex structure or nuanced meanings, as they could provide richer information for the learning process.

Given these principles, I will now select 25 instances from the provided dataset:

10, 45, 46, 49, 51, 52, 57, 60, 62, 65, 68, 69, 72, 74, 77, 79, 81, 82, 84, 87, 88, 92, 94, 95, 96

These instances were chosen based on their diversity, apparent complexity or ambiguity, and potential representativeness of different aspects of the dataset. This selection aims to provide a broad and informative set of examples for the annotator to label, which should aid in effectively training the model.
