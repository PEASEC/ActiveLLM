 #####

 ##### 
99. great reception , visibility and interface ( may be complicated by others ) [ID: 3205]
 ##### 
100. i wash ours out with lysol each time i empty it , and that helps , but when its hot out well , just be prepared [ID: 2161]
 ##### 
101. the ear buds that come with it look cheap , but the sound quality is amazing [ID: 148]

102. protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window [ID: 1263]
 ##### 
103. 1 ) price gb of storage [ID: 1714]
 ##### 
104. with accessories , you can make the ipod into a digital recorder , broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology , and play it through your car speakers using either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster [ID: 2026]
 ##### 
105. freebies you get a cradle with detachable stand and belt clip , some thing very handy and useful [ID: 2763]
 ##### 
106. it ' s running great for all the dvds i have and rented [ID: 3331]

 ##### 
125. ( i never know when the champ is full as there is no way too tell even though not particularly aesthetic , how about making the champ clear and see through ? ) so , i lift the lid and find a wad of diaper , which i must remove , usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full [ID: 353]
 ##### 
126. replacement battery is 50 compared to ipod ' s 150 [ID: 2132]
 ##### 
127. the fine adjustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table [ID: 1827]
 ##### 
128. it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted [ID: 3022]
 ##### 
129. everything i wanted ! the apple ipod has become one of the most sought after electronic gadgets and for good reason [ID: 3388]
 #####

 ##### 
131. i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd ' s , after the frustration and aggravation of getting the player to do it ' s job [ID: 1353]

 ##### 
142. also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying [ID: 2113]
 ##### 
143. really like it , easy to use , great images , very intuitive , fits in my jacket pocket [ID: 2734]

144. the only other problem was that security for the wireless connection [ID: 1075]
 ##### 
145. the moveable lcd screen is great [ID: 910]
 ##### 
146. while i would like to give it 3 5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it [ID: 2334]
 ##### 
147. however , configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours , and briefly made me reconsider my choice to for ego the airport and its notoriously easy setup [ID: 815]

 ##### 
157. it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation [ID: 1499]
 ##### 
158. the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case [ID: 621]

 ##### 
167. then , my ad pop up blocking was completely gone [ID: 1063]
 ##### 
168. 7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch [ID: 1934]

 ##### 
176. typically , the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others [ID: 697]
 ##### 
177. the problems i had installing norton extended way beyond what symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with [ID: 645]
 ##### 
178. the panorama setting is unbelievable ! [ID: 3314]
 ##### 
179. it looks sleek and modern [ID: 2953]
 ##### 
180. the zen does n ' t support folders so it is not really a storage device even with third party software that creates folders , documents and programs can ' t be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it ' s a storage device at best [ID: 2245]
 ##### 
181. 4 my idea was that it was an all in one , and that theory once again proves wrong , this phone ex cells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the other than phone functionalists , you ' ll be disappointed if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine but don ' t expect to get much done [ID: 1695]

 ##### 
188. the picture is perfect , although i ' m not watching on an hdtv [ID: 16]
 ##### 
189. the dvd player just would ' t recognize them [ID: 2043]
 ##### 
190. every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes [ID: 993]
 ##### 
191. transferring music is a breeze i don ' t subscribe to music services , but as mentioned on other reviews , micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes [ID: 3341]
 ##### 
192. the voice recorder is a beautiful add on not even necessary , but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player [ID: 2506]
 ##### 
193. but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n ' t anticipate any problems with it [ID: 3075]
 ##### 
194. fyi , battery doesn ' t die if you don ' t use lcd [ID: 2198]
 ##### 
195. the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings [ID: 1861]
 ##### 
196. imagine my disappointment , though , when the zen micro proved able to play only the mega strongest fm signals in my area [ID: 529]
 ##### 
197. the product also leaves a faint smell in the room [ID: 1787]
 ##### 
198. you have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost [ID: 77]
 ##### 
199. first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed [ID: 1367]
 #####
