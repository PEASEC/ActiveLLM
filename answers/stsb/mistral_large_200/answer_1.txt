To select the instances to label, I would consider the following factors:

1. Diversity: Select instances that cover a wide range of topics, writing styles, and sentence structures.
2. Ambiguity: Prioritize instances where the meaning or relationship between the two sentences is unclear or could be interpreted in multiple ways.
3. Difficulty: Choose instances that seem challenging to classify, as these are likely to be the most informative for the model.
4. Representation: Ensure that the selected instances are representative of the overall dataset, taking into account any specific domains or categories that the dataset covers.

Based on these criteria, I would select the following instances to label:

3, 5, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69.
