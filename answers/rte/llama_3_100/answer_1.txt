I will choose the instances that the annotator has to label. I will select a diverse set of instances to maximize the learning potential. Here are the 32 instances I have chosen:

1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 18, 23, 26, 28, 30, 31, 33, 36, 39, 41, 44, 45, 46, 49, 51, 54, 57, 59, 61, 62, 64, 66, 71, 73, 77, 81, 83

These instances cover a range of topics, including politics, health, entertainment, and more. They also vary in terms of syntax, semantics, and difficulty, which will help the annotator to develop a comprehensive understanding of the task.
