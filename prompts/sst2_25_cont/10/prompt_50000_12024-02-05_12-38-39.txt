what made allen 's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring

an incoherent jumble of a film that 's rarely as entertaining as it could have been .

jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe

 ##### 
muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner . 
 ##### 
the film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma , but what makes it transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years . 
 ##### 
smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds . 
 ##### 
is n't much fun . 
 ##### 
jolie gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters , especially if you 're in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging . 
 ##### 
've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times 
 ##### 
the film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either does n't notice when his story ends or just ca n't tear himself away from the characters -- but

might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around 
 ##### 
the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of gator-bashing are consistently delightful . 
 ##### 
forces us to consider the unthinkable , the unacceptable , the unmentionable 
 ##### 
creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters 
 ##### 
unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either . 
 ##### 
impressive talent 
 ##### 
a freaky bit of art that 's there to scare while we delight in the images 
 ##### 
not only better than its predecessor 
 ##### 
as they come , already having been recycled more times than i 'd care to count 
 ##### 
that 's enough to sustain laughs 
 ##### 
's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey

 ##### 
's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through 
 ##### 
, it actually hurts to watch . 
 ##### 
enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded 
 ##### 
is a cinematic car wreck , a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride 
 ##### 
it will just as likely make you weep , and it will do so in a way that does n't make you feel like a sucker .

painfully unfunny

unfortunately , it 's also not very good .

can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace . 
 ##### 
godard 's ode to tackling life 's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ... in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that 's unfocused and tediously exasperating .

ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix 's

spy kids 2 also happens to be that rarity among sequels : 
 ##### 
most amazing super-sized dosage 
 ##### 
look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar 
 ##### 
it 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .

two not very absorbing characters

every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel . 
 ##### 
plays out ... like a high-end john hughes comedy , a kind of elder bueller 's time out .

a dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs

pseudo-philosophic

is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work

, this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday . 
 ##### 
once amusing

that frenetic spectacle ( on the tv show )

puts the sting back into the con

for the most part , the film is deadly dull

distinctly sub-par

it were that grand a failure

a complete waste of time .

good film 
 ##### 
one of the most interesting writer/directors working today 
 ##### 
rock solid family fun out of the gates , extremely imaginative through out , but wanes in the middle 
 ##### 
it 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
 ##### 
destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country . 
 ##### 
does an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and 
 ##### 
this is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences ... and 
 ##### 
the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films 
 ##### 
feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas . 
 ##### 
an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention 
 ##### 
clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes .

thriller as lazy

to a night in the living room than a night at the movies 
 ##### 
is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
 ##### 
consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable 
 ##### 
than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run 
 ##### 
hedonistic 
 ##### 
a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically 
 ##### 
working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by gianni romoli ... ozpetek avoids most of the pitfalls you 'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up 
 ##### 
the unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing kaufman has carved from orleans ' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality . 
 ##### 
more than merely a holocaust movie 
 ##### 
that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right

of the killing field and the barbarism of ` ethnic cleansing

 ##### 
we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies . 
 ##### 
miraculous as its dreamworks makers 
 ##### 
'll want to crawl up your own *** in embarrassment 
 ##### 
a wild ride of a movie that keeps throwing fastballs 
 ##### 
it 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence . 
 ##### 
this ready-made midnight movie probably wo n't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it 's goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun 
 ##### 
is a relationship that is worthy of our respect 
 ##### 
mainly because blanchett and ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters ' suffering 
 ##### 
plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air 
 ##### 
is a rambling examination of american gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition 
 ##### 
an incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief 
 ##### 
has fun with the quirks of family life 
 ##### 
the emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task . 
 ##### 
stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric

tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving 
 ##### 
to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once 
 ##### 
amused by its special effects 
 ##### 
there are n't many conclusive answers in the film , but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs. the big guys . 
 ##### 
an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something 
 ##### 
aimless , arduous , and 
 ##### 
oddly compelling 
 ##### 
's a reason the studio did n't offer an advance screening 
 ##### 
bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer 's most pleasurable movies 
 #####

 ##### 
tom green 's freddie got fingered 
 ##### 
high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd . 
 ##### 
it 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . 
 ##### 
supplies with tremendous skill 
 ##### 
's great for the kids 
 ##### 
takes a potentially trite and overused concept ( aliens come to earth ) and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion . 
 ##### 
maintains an appealing veneer without becoming too cute about it . 
 ##### 
plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp . 
 ##### 
leaves little doubt that kidman has become one of our best actors 
 ##### 
a compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day 
 ##### 
comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness . 
 ##### 
though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should . 
 ##### 
a fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor , sensuality , and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys . 
 ##### 
a determined woman 's courage to find her husband in a war zone 
 ##### 
an improvement on the first blade

impossible to claim that it is `` based on a true story ''

 ##### 
a deeper story 
 ##### 
such conviction 
 ##### 
i liked it because it was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive . 
 ##### 
can enjoy much of jonah simply , and gratefully , as laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor . 
 ##### 
a culture-clash comedy that , in addition to being very funny , 
 ##### 
bundling the flowers of perversity , comedy and romance into a strangely tempting bouquet of a movie 
 ##### 
is richly detailed , deftly executed and utterly absorbing . 
 ##### 
a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism . 
 ##### 
what 's so striking about jolie 's performance is that she never lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair . 
 ##### 
not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time . 
 ##### 
perfectly creepy and believable 
 ##### 
an intriguing look at the french film industry during the german occupation 
 ##### 
a meditation on faith and madness 
 ##### 
bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i have n't encountered since at least pete 's dragon . 
 ##### 
a memorable directorial debut 
 ##### 
i do n't know if frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he 's made at least one damn fine horror movie 
 ##### 
's enough cool fun here to warm the hearts of animation enthusiasts of all ages 
 ##### 
puts a human face on derrida , and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible 
 #####

 ##### 
powerful and astonishingly vivid 
 ##### 
the most brilliant work in this genre since the 1984 uncut version of sergio leone 's flawed but staggering once upon a time in america . 
 ##### 
shiri is an action film that delivers on the promise of excitement , but it also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience . 
 ##### 
there 's none of the happily-ever - after spangle of monsoon wedding in late marriage -- and that 's part of what makes dover kosashvili 's outstanding feature debut so potent . 
 ##### 
also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl 
 ##### 
is the best little `` horror '' movie i 've seen in years 
 ##### 
the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics 
 ##### 
like a glossy rehash 
 ##### 
horribly depressing and 
 ##### 
touching drama 
 ##### 
a bilingual charmer 
 ##### 
, we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it 's hard to stop watching . 
 ##### 
such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us `` the skulls '' and last year 's `` rollerball . '' 
 ##### 
a fantastically vital movie 
 ##### 
engrossing 
 ##### 
of emotionally and narratively complex filmmaking

, brutally clueless

a fascinating case study of flower-power liberation -- and 
 ##### 
viewers out in the cold 
 ##### 
bland animated sequel 
 ##### 
caruso sometimes descends into sub-tarantino cuteness ... but for the most part he makes sure the salton sea works the way a good noir should , keeping it tight and nasty . 
 ##### 
offensive and 
 ##### 
solid , satisfying fare for adults 
 ##### 
that make it well worth watching 
 ##### 
's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre . 
 ##### 
of the band 
 ##### 
pack your knitting needles . 
 ##### 
a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title 
 ##### 
rooted in a sincere performance 
 ##### 
taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history 
 ##### 
the crazy things that keep people going in this crazy life
