To select instances for labeling in an active learning context, the goal is to choose those instances that are most informative and would help improve the model's performance most effectively. Given the dataset of sentences with their indices and considering that a certain number of instances have already been labeled, here's a step-by-step approach to selecting instances:

1. **Diversity Sampling**: Choose instances that cover a broad range of the data's feature space. This ensures that the model learns from as wide a variety of examples as possible. From the given dataset, it appears to be text data possibly for sentiment analysis or another form of text classification.

2. **Uncertainty Sampling**: Focus on instances where the current model's predictions are most uncertain. This might not be directly applicable since the current setup doesn't provide a way to assess model uncertainty without additional context, like model predictions.

3. **Error Analysis**: If any prior errors or challenging instances are known (for example, instances where similar models have struggled), prioritize similar instances to improve in those areas.

4. **Stratified Sampling**: If the dataset is imbalanced or if certain categories are underrepresented, select more instances from those categories to ensure the model learns well across all classes.

Without access to model predictions or specific details about the dataset beyond the instances provided, the selection will primarily focus on diversity and potential informativeness based on the content of the instances.

Given that some instances have already been labeled, the goal will be to select a diverse set of 25 new instances, ensuring a range of expressions, sentiments, and topics to potentially cover a broad spectrum of the dataset's feature space. Since the dataset's content varies widely in sentiment, subject matter, and complexity, the selection will aim to include:

- Instances with unique thematic elements that are not well represented in the already labeled set.
- Instances that might introduce new vocabulary or concepts not covered by the already labeled instances.
- Instances that seem ambiguous or complex, which could be informative for the model.

Given the constraint of selecting 25 instances without explicit feedback loops from model predictions or detailed dataset annotations (such as categories or themes for stratification), the selection process will be somewhat heuristic. Let's proceed to select a diverse set of instances for labeling.

The instances selected for labeling, aiming for diversity and potential informativeness, are:

191, 194, 199, 201, 270, 277, 287, 299, 331, 427, 433, 443, 457, 490, 652, 744, 788, 805, 836, 849, 887, 925, 987, 991, 992

These instances were chosen to provide a broad representation across the dataset's features, potentially including different sentiments, topics, and complexities to aid in the model's learning process.
