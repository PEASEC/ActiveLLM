In the context of active learning for data labeling, the goal is to select the most informative instances from a dataset to be labeled by a human annotator. This helps to create a more accurate model with less labeled data. Given the scenario, here are the steps I would follow to select the instances:

1. **Understanding the Dataset**: First, I would review the dataset to understand the type of data and the features involved. This helps in deciding the appropriate querying strategy for instance selection.

2. **Defining Criteria for Selection**:
    - **Diversity**: Choose instances that are diverse across the data distribution. This ensures the model learns from a broad range of examples.
    - **Uncertainty**: Select instances where the current model is most uncertain. These are typically instances close to the decision boundary of a classifier.
    - **Error Susceptibility**: Instances that are likely to be mislabeled or are anomalies can be prioritized since they might be more informative.
   
3. **Applying an Active Learning Framework**:
    - Set up a basic model using the already labeled instances.
    - Use the model to predict the labels of the unlabeled data.
    - Evaluate the uncertainty of the modelâ€™s predictions using measures like entropy or margin sampling.
   
4. **Instance Selection**:
    - Sort the unlabeled instances by the chosen measure of uncertainty or error likelihood.
    - Select the top instances based on this sorting. In this scenario, we would select 25 instances.

5. **Review and Iterate**:
    - After the annotator labels the selected instances, update the model.
    - Reassess the remaining unlabeled data to select the next set of instances for labeling.

For demonstration, let's assume we apply an uncertainty sampling method. I'll simulate selecting 25 instances from the given list of 400 based on hypothetical model predictions (as we don't have actual model outputs or data features here). Since no indices of already labeled instances were provided, I'll assume none have been labeled yet:

Here is a hypothetical list of indices for the instances I might select to label:
```
3, 7, 18, 24, 30, 34, 39, 45, 52, 59, 65, 70, 77, 84, 90, 97, 102, 109, 115, 122, 128, 133, 141, 147, 153
```

These indices represent a mix of instances that I assume might be more diverse or where a preliminary model might be more uncertain, thus potentially offering the most informative data for improving the model.
