To select the most informative instances for a human annotator to label, I would consider a few key strategies:

1. **Diversity of Topics**: Ensure that the selected instances cover a wide range of topics. This helps in creating a balanced and comprehensive dataset.

2. **Complexity and Ambiguity**: Choose questions that are either complex or have some level of ambiguity. These instances are likely to benefit more from human annotation as they might be challenging for automated systems.

3. **Representativeness**: Select instances that are representative of the overall dataset. This includes considering the frequency of certain types of questions.

4. **Variability in Answers**: Instances where answers might vary greatly or where there's a potential for multiple interpretations are valuable for human annotation.

5. **Quality of Questions**: Choose well-structured and clear questions. Poorly formulated questions might lead to inconsistent labeling.

Based on these criteria, I would select the following instances:

0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 28, 32, 33, 35, 39, 41, 43, 46, 49, 53, 56, 62, 65, 69, 73, 77, 80, 89, 91

These instances represent a diversity of topics, contain complex or ambiguous questions, and are likely to benefit significantly from human annotation.
