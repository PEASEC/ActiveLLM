To select the most informative instances for labeling by a human annotator in an active learning context, the following steps would be followed:

1. **Assess the Diversity of Instances**: Since the goal is to improve the model's performance across a wide range of data, it's crucial to select a diverse set of instances. This involves choosing examples that vary significantly in content and style.

2. **Identify Ambiguous or Challenging Cases**: Instances that are likely to be challenging or ambiguous for the model should be prioritized. These are instances where the model is uncertain and hence can learn the most from human annotation.

3. **Ensure a Balance of Categories**: If the instances belong to different categories or classes, ensuring a balance across these categories is important to prevent the model from becoming biased towards one category.

4. **Consider the Representativeness**: Selected instances should be representative of the overall dataset. This means avoiding too many outliers or instances that are too similar to each other.

5. **Stratify by Length and Complexity**: If applicable, instances should be selected across a range of lengths and complexities to ensure the model can handle various input types.

Given these guidelines, I will select 32 instances from the provided dataset, ensuring diversity, challenge, balance, representativeness, and a range of complexities. Let's review the instances and make the selection.

After reviewing the instances, the selected ones for labeling are:
0, 1, 5, 6, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 25, 27, 31, 36, 43, 46, 49, 53, 55, 61, 64, 67, 73, 79, 83, 87, 92, 98, 102, 109, 115, 121, 126

These instances represent a mix of different styles, complexities, and potential ambiguities, making them valuable for improving the model's performance.
