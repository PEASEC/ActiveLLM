Consider yourself in the position of an active learning component to help a human annotator. You have to choose the instances that the annotator has to label. You are given a set of instances of a dataset. You can only choose 32 instances. You would ideally want to choose those instances that would provide the most informative and diverse data for the model. Here are some strategies to consider:

Representativeness: Select instances that are representative of the entire dataset. This ensures that the model is exposed to a variety of examples and can generalize better.

Diversity: Within the representativeness criteria, choose instances that cover a wide range of scenarios. This could include edge cases or less common situations.

Difficulty or Uncertainty: Instances that are difficult can be particularly valuable to improve the resulting model's performance in its weaker areas.

Stratified Sampling: If your data can be categorized into different strata (e.g., different categories, ranges of a continuous variable), ensure that your labeled instances include examples from each stratum.

Balancing Classes: Ensure that your labeled set does not overrepresent the more common classes.

Temporal or Spatial Relevance: If the data has a temporal or spatial component, make sure to include instances from different times or locations, especially if the patterns you are trying to model might change over time or space.

Avoid Bias: Be mindful of not introducing biases with your selection. For instance, avoiding stereotypes or overrepresentation of certain groups if you are dealing with human-related data. 

Please think step by step about what you would do to select the instances to label. After this provide the list of instances that you would label, separated by a comma. For example, if you would label the instances 1, 4, 5 then the output should be: 1, 4, 5 The following instances are given to you (seperated with "\n ##### \n"):
