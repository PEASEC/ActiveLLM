To select the instances for the human annotator to label, I will first review the guidelines provided and then analyze each instance based on these criteria. The guidelines emphasize the importance of relevance to cybersecurity experts, focusing on specific information about vulnerabilities, exploits, and mitigation strategies. Tweets containing numbers, methods, proof of concepts, code, fixes, or IOCs (such as IPs, hashes, malware names, exploits, or CVE IDs) are considered relevant.

I will assess each tweet to determine if it fits these criteria, while also considering the guideline to label as "Not Relevant" posts that are too general, speculative, or aimed at the general public, as well as those that contain political motivations, spam, or are overly vague about the linked content.

Based on these guidelines, here are the instances I would select for labeling:

1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, 25, 26, 28, 29, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 40, 43, 44, 46, 55, 57, 58, 65, 80, 82, 83, 85, 90, 92, 95, 105, 107, 108, 110, 114, 115, 116, 118, 120, 121, 123, 125, 126, 127, 130, 132, 134, 135, 140, 141, 142, 143, 147, 149, 150, 155, 160, 161, 162, 164, 165, 170, 172, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 187, 188, 190, 198, 202, 204, 205, 206, 208, 209, 210, 211, 214, 215, 216, 217, 219, 220, 221, 223, 225, 226, 228, 229, 231, 233, 235, 236, 237, 239, 240, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300.
