To select 25 instances for labeling by a human annotator in an active learning scenario, we would follow a systematic approach to ensure that the chosen instances are informative and diverse. This approach would involve several steps:

Analyze Already Labeled Instances: Examine the characteristics of already labeled instances to understand the variety of data, such as sentiment, subject matter, and complexity. This helps in identifying gaps or underrepresented areas.

Diversity and Representativeness: Ensure that the selected instances for labeling cover a broad spectrum of the dataset. This includes different sentiments (positive, negative, neutral), genres (comedy, drama, action, etc.), and any other relevant dimensions.

Uncertainty Sampling: Prioritize instances where the model's predictions are most uncertain. This often means selecting instances that are close to the decision boundary of a classifier.

Error Analysis: Identify any common errors or weaknesses in the current model by analyzing instances where the model performs poorly. Selecting similar instances for labeling can help address these weaknesses.

Stratified Sampling: If the dataset is known to have certain stratifications or clusters, ensure that instances from each stratum or cluster are selected to maintain the diversity of the dataset.

Given these considerations, the selection of instances for labeling would ideally focus on those that are likely to improve the model the most. This means choosing instances that are diverse, cover gaps in the labeled dataset, and are near the model's current decision boundaries.

Without access to the model's predictions or the ability to perform a detailed analysis of the instances' content beyond their descriptions, the selection will be based on ensuring diversity and addressing potential gaps in the labeled dataset. For example, we would select instances that represent a range of sentiments, include both clear and ambiguous cases, and cover a variety of subjects.

Let's select 25 instances based on their brief descriptions, aiming for a mix of sentiments, topics, and clarity:

1111 (fiercely clever and subtle film)
1116 (brutal and funny)
1119 (is so film-culture referential)
1123 (the chatter of parrots raised on oprah)
1133 (it's tough to watch, but it's a fantastic movie)
1136 (madonna has made herself over)
1143 (the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting)
1154 (exceptional thriller)
1157 (bloodwork isn't a terrible movie)
1162 (never rise above the level of an after-school tv special)
1164 (every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians)
1168 (spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects)
1172 (snide)
1177 (the film doesn't have enough innovation)
1181 (fun about this silly, outrageous, ingenious thriller)
1183 (conrad l. hall's cinematography)
1186 (the art direction is often exquisite)
1193 (everything kieslowski's work aspired to)
1196 (the problem with the mayhem in formula 51)
1203 (is funny, charming and quirky)
1211 (point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers)
1223 (is genuinely witty)
1232 (daringly perceptive, taut, piercing and feisty)
1240 (the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism)
1255 (an energizing, intoxicating documentary)
This selection aims to cover a variety of tones, topics, and styles to provide a comprehensive set of instances for the human annotator to label, potentially improving the model's performance across a broader spectrum of data.
