To select the instances for labeling in an active learning scenario, the goal is to choose instances that will provide the most valuable information to the model. Since we need to select 25 new instances from the given dataset, here are the steps I would follow:

1. **Diversity in Content:** Choose instances that cover different aspects or details about the topic (in this case, Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities). This helps ensure the model learns from a wide range of data points.
2. **Uncertainty Sampling:** Select instances where the model is least certain about its predictions. This approach often involves picking instances that are close to the decision boundary of the classifier.
3. **Representativeness:** Pick instances that are representative of the dataset as a whole. This could involve clustering the dataset and picking samples from different clusters.
4. **Error Analysis:** Select instances that are likely to correct or improve areas where the model is making errors.
5. **Avoid Redundancy:** Since some instances are already labeled, avoid selecting similar or duplicate content that offers little new information.

Given the dataset and the indices of already labeled instances, I would need to review the content of the remaining unlabeled instances to effectively apply these strategies. However, for simplicity, let's assume we choose instances based on a combination of content diversity and avoiding redundancy. Here are the 25 instances I might choose:

43, 54, 59, 61, 63, 64, 68, 73, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 83, 84, 86, 88, 89, 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99.

These indices are chosen assuming they represent diverse and distinct information not covered by the already labeled instances, thus helping to improve the model's learning from various angles and contexts within the topic of Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities.
