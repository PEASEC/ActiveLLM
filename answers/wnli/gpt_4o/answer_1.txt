To select the 32 instances to label, I would use an active learning strategy that aims to maximize the informativeness and diversity of the selected instances. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Ambiguity and Confusion**: Instances with pronouns or ambiguous references where the antecedent is unclear are likely to be more informative. These instances can help improve the model's understanding of such cases.
2. **Balance Between Categories**: Ensure a mix of different types of pronoun references (e.g., personal pronouns, possessive pronouns, reflexive pronouns).
3. **Variety in Context**: Select instances from different contexts and domains to cover a wide range of scenarios.
4. **Edge Cases**: Include instances that are likely to be edge cases or difficult examples, as these can be crucial for improving the model.

Using these criteria, here is the list of 32 instances selected for labeling:

0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38
