To effectively select 32 instances from the dataset for labeling by a human annotator, I would follow a strategic approach, considering various factors that ensure a diverse and informative set of instances. Here's my step-by-step process:

1. **Understand the Dataset Theme**: The dataset seems to be focused on Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities, hacks, and related cybersecurity issues. This understanding will guide the selection process to ensure relevance and diversity.

2. **Diversity in Content and Source**: To gain a comprehensive understanding, it's important to select instances that cover different aspects of the Microsoft Exchange issue (e.g., technical details, impacts, solutions) and come from various sources (e.g., news outlets, cybersecurity blogs, official Microsoft updates).

3. **Temporal Relevance**: Select instances from different time periods to capture the evolution of the issue. This includes initial reports, ongoing developments, and the latest updates.

4. **Technical Detail and Layman Explanation**: Include some instances that are technically detailed for a deep understanding and others that are explained in layman's terms for broader comprehension.

5. **Global and Local Perspectives**: Choose instances that provide a global overview of the issue as well as those that focus on local or regional impacts.

6. **Official Statements and Community Responses**: Select official statements (e.g., from Microsoft, cybersecurity agencies) and community responses (e.g., tweets, forum discussions) for a balanced view.

Based on these criteria, I would select the following instances for labeling:

0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, 29, 32, 33, 36, 37, 39, 43, 46, 48, 53, 56, 61, 64, 67, 70

This selection ensures a broad and comprehensive coverage of the Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability issue, providing a rich dataset for analysis and learning.
