To select the 25 most informative instances for labeling, I would apply the principles of active learning, particularly diversity and representativeness. The goal is to choose instances that provide the most valuable information for improving the model's performance. Here's my step-by-step approach:

1. **Avoid Redundancy**: I would avoid selecting instances that are too similar to already labeled ones to ensure diversity.

2. **Representativeness**: Choose instances that are representative of the entire dataset, covering a broad range of the data's characteristics.

3. **Uncertainty Sampling**: Select instances where the model's current predictions are least confident, as these are likely to provide new information.

4. **Variety in Length and Complexity**: Include instances of varying lengths and complexities to ensure the model learns to handle a wide range of inputs.

5. **Balanced Selection**: If applicable, ensure a balanced selection across different categories or types within the dataset.

Given these principles, I'll select 25 instances from the provided list, ensuring they are diverse, representative, and potentially informative based on their content and structure.

Let's select the instances.

Based on the principles of active learning, focusing on diversity and representativeness, and avoiding redundancy with already labeled instances, I have selected the following 25 instances for labeling:

109, 122, 137, 149, 158, 179, 183, 184, 198, 215, 223, 232, 249, 255, 258, 267, 278, 280, 297, 301, 311, 314, 327, 335, 338

These instances were chosen to provide a broad and varied perspective, potentially enhancing the model's learning with new and diverse information.
