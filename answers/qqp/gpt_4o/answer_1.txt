To select the most informative instances for labeling, I will consider the following strategies:

1. **Diversity Sampling**: Choose questions that cover a wide range of topics to ensure a diverse dataset.
2. **Uncertainty Sampling**: Focus on instances where the model is least confident to improve model performance on hard-to-predict examples.
3. **Representativeness**: Select instances that are representative of the overall dataset to maintain balance.

Given the nature of the dataset, I'll also consider redundancy and ensure we avoid duplicate or near-duplicate pairs.

Here are the instances I would label:

1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 37, 40, 42, 45, 47, 50
