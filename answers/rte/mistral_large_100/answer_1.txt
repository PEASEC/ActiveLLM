To select the instances to label, I would first look for sentences that seem to have a clear factual statement or claim. I would also prioritize sentences that have a clear subject and object, as these are often easier to annotate. I would also try to select a diverse range of sentences, in terms of both their content and their structure.

Here are the 32 instances I would choose to label:

0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33

These instances cover a wide range of topics, including technology, politics, history, and science, and they include a variety of sentence structures, such as declarative sentences, questions, and sentences with complex clauses. They also include a mix of true and false statements, which will allow the annotator to practice identifying and labeling both types of sentences.
