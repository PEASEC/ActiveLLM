To select the most informative instances for labeling in an active learning scenario, I would follow these steps:

1. **Diversity in Content:** Ensure the selected instances cover a wide range of topics and styles within the dataset. This helps in building a model that can generalize better across the dataset.

2. **Representativeness:** Choose instances that are representative of the entire dataset. This includes selecting instances from different subtopics or categories present in the data.

3. **Difficulty or Uncertainty:** Prefer instances where the model is most uncertain about its predictions. These are typically instances that the model finds difficult to classify or annotate.

4. **Novelty:** Select instances that seem to bring new information or different perspectives compared to already labeled data. This can include unique cases or rare examples.

5. **Avoid Redundancy:** Avoid selecting instances that are very similar to each other or to already labeled data, as they add little new information.

Given these guidelines, I'll review the instances and select 32 that best fit these criteria. 

After analyzing the given instances, which all relate to Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities and cybersecurity issues, my selections are:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.

These selections aim to cover a broad range of aspects related to the topic, including different types of attacks, responses, tools, and updates regarding Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities.
