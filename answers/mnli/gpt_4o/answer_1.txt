To choose the instances for labeling, I would use a strategy that aims to maximize the information gained from the labeled instances. Here are some steps I would take:

1. **Diversity of Instances:** Select instances that cover a wide range of topics and types of premises and hypotheses to ensure the model gets varied information.
2. **Uncertainty Sampling:** If the model's predictions are available, choose instances where the model is least certain about the prediction. This often involves selecting instances with prediction probabilities closest to 0.5 in a binary classification task.
3. **Error Analysis:** If the model's errors are known, prioritize instances similar to those the model has previously misclassified.
4. **Representative Sampling:** Ensure the selected instances are representative of the dataset's distribution.

Given the above principles and the provided dataset, I would select the following instances to label:

2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 21, 25, 26, 30, 33, 37, 39, 41, 45, 49, 54, 58, 60, 65, 67, 73, 78, 85, 89, 94, 98, 100
