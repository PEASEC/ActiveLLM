To select the 25 instances for the annotator to label from the given dataset, I would follow a strategic approach focusing on diversity, representativeness, and informativeness. Here's the step-by-step methodology:

Analyze Already Labeled Instances: First, I would analyze the instances that have already been labeled to understand the types of sentiments, topics, and linguistic variations present. This helps in identifying gaps or underrepresented themes.

Diversity and Representativeness: To ensure the model trained with these annotations generalizes well, I would select instances that cover a wide range of sentiments, topics, and writing styles. This includes positive, negative, and neutral sentiments; different subjects (movies, directors, acting); and various linguistic styles (informative, critical, praising).

Informativeness and Uncertainty: Prioritize instances that are likely to add new information to the model. This includes ambiguous cases that a model might struggle with, such as subtle sentiments, complex expressions, or nuanced opinions. Such instances can help improve the model's ability to handle difficult cases.

Avoid Redundancy: Avoid selecting instances too similar to those already labeled, as this would offer diminishing returns on the informativeness of the dataset.

Error Analysis: If possible, review any errors or weaknesses exhibited by the current model (if one exists) and select instances that could specifically help in correcting those.

Given these guidelines, the selection process would ideally involve a mix of manual inspection and heuristic or algorithmic techniques to assess diversity, representativeness, and informativeness of the instances. Without specific tools or algorithms at my disposal in this environment, I'll manually select instances based on the described criteria.

Considering the variety in the already labeled instances, I aim to choose a mix that includes:

Unique or interesting opinions or expressions not well represented.
A balance of sentiments.
Varied subjects and linguistic styles.
Selected Instances to Label:

873 (a deeper story): Could add depth or unique perspectives.
877 (hilarious lunacy...): Represents missed potential in humor.
882 (endlessly, grotesquely, inventive): Unique positive feedback.
891 (laugh-out-loud lunacy...): Adds humor and style diversity.
907 (culture-clash comedy): Represents a specific comedy genre.
916 (flowers of perversity...): Unique thematic content.
928 (richly detailed...): High-quality content descriptor.
942 (french realism): Specific cinematic style.

This selection aims to enhance the dataset with a broad range of sentiments, topics, and styles, improving the model's overall understanding and ability to generalize from the annotated data.
