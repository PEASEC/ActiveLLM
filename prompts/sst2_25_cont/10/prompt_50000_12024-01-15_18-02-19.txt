creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters

rock solid family fun out of the gates , extremely imaginative through out , but wanes in the middle

 ##### 
destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country . 
 ##### 
does an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and 
 ##### 
this is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences ... and

the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films

a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically

this ready-made midnight movie probably wo n't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it 's goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun

is a relationship that is worthy of our respect

mainly because blanchett and ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters ' suffering

plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air
