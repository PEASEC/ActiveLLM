To select the most informative instances for labeling in an active learning scenario, I would consider the following steps:

1. **Diversity and Representativeness**: Choose instances that are diverse and represent different aspects of the dataset. This helps in building a more generalized model.

2. **Uncertainty Sampling**: Prefer instances where the current model is most uncertain, as labeling these would provide the most information.

3. **Similarity and Redundancy**: Avoid instances that are very similar to each other to prevent redundancy.

4. **Balancing Categories**: If the dataset has categories or labels, ensure a balance across these categories in the selection.

5. **Difficulty**: Select instances that are likely to be challenging or have been misclassified in previous iterations, as these could lead to significant improvements in the model.

6. **Potential for Disambiguation**: Choose instances that could help disambiguate between closely related concepts or categories.

Based on these criteria, here are the instances I would choose from the provided dataset for labeling:

0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20, 24, 28, 30, 34, 38, 41, 45, 47, 50, 53, 56, 57, 61, 62, 70, 72, 79, 85, 87

These instances are selected to cover a range of topics, exhibit varying levels of difficulty and uncertainty, and are representative of different types of questions in the dataset.
