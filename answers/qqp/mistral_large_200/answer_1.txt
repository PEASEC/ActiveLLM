To select the instances to label, I would follow these steps:

1. **Diversity**: Select instances that cover a wide range of topics. This will ensure that the model learns to handle different types of questions.
2. **Uncertainty**: Choose instances where the model's confidence is low. These are likely to be the instances where the model needs the most help.
3. **Representativeness**: Select instances that are representative of the overall dataset. This will ensure that the model's performance on the labeled instances generalizes well to the rest of the dataset.

Based on these criteria, I would select the following instances to label:

0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150, 155

This selection covers a wide range of topics, includes instances where the model's confidence might be low (based on the complexity of the questions), and is representative of the overall dataset.
