To select the most informative instances for labeling, I would follow a strategy that aims to cover a wide range of variability in the dataset. Here's how I would approach this task:

1. **Understand the Dataset's Nature**: First, I would assess the nature of the dataset. From the instances provided, it appears to be a collection of movie reviews with varied sentiments and styles.

2. **Diversity in Sentiment**: I would ensure to select instances that represent a range of sentiments - positive, negative, and neutral. This helps in building a balanced and comprehensive model.

3. **Complexity and Ambiguity**: Instances with complex or ambiguous sentiments are often more informative for training a model, so I would include some of these.

4. **Unique and Idiosyncratic Instances**: Reviews with unique vocabulary, style, or structure can be valuable for understanding the edges of the dataset.

5. **Representation of Different Themes**: Since these are movie reviews, I would also aim to cover a range of genres or themes mentioned in the reviews.

6. **Avoid Redundancy**: I would avoid selecting multiple instances that are very similar in sentiment or content.

Based on these criteria, I will now select 40 instances from the provided dataset. Note that without a specific task or model in mind, this selection aims for general diversity and informativeness.

Selected Instances: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19, 21, 24, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 43, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 85, 88, 91, 94, 98, 101, 104.
