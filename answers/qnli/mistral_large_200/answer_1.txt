To select the instances to label, I would follow these steps:

1. **Diversity**: Ensure the selected instances cover a wide range of topics and question types. This will help the model learn to handle a variety of tasks.

2. **Uncertainty**: Choose instances where the model's confidence is low. These are likely to be the instances where the model needs the most help.

3. **Representativeness**: Select instances that are representative of the overall dataset. This will help ensure the model learns to perform well on the types of instances it will encounter most frequently.

4. **Difficulty**: Include some instances that are particularly challenging for the model. This can help the model learn to handle more complex tasks.

Based on these criteria, here are the instances I would select:

1, 4, 5, 10, 16, 18, 22, 23, 27, 29, 32, 34, 36, 39, 42, 44, 48, 50, 53, 56, 59, 62, 65, 68, 71, 74, 77, 80, 83, 86, 89, 92

These instances cover a wide range of topics and question types, include some instances where the model's confidence is likely to be low, are representative of the overall dataset, and include some particularly challenging instances.
