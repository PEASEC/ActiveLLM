To select 25 instances for labeling from the given dataset, while considering that some instances have already been labeled, I would follow these steps:

1. **Diversity in Content**: Prioritize selecting instances that represent a diverse range of content. This includes different lengths, styles, and topics of text. Diversity ensures a more comprehensive understanding of the dataset's variability.

2. **Representativeness**: Choose instances that are representative of the overall dataset. This means avoiding overly unique or outlier instances unless they form a significant portion of the data.

3. **Stratified Sampling**: If the dataset has identifiable subgroups, ensure that instances from each subgroup are included. This helps in maintaining the overall structure of the dataset in the sample.

4. **Randomness**: Include an element of randomness to avoid any bias in selection. This can be done by randomly selecting from a pool of instances that meet the above criteria.

5. **Avoid Already Labeled Instances**: Ensure that none of the selected instances are among those already labeled.

Given these steps and the constraints, I will now select 25 instances from the dataset, ensuring they are not among the already labeled instances. Let's proceed with the selection:

Based on the criteria and the selection process, the following 25 instances would be chosen for labeling:

108, 132, 141, 163, 168, 175, 178, 182, 193, 201, 209, 217, 240, 244, 248, 265, 269, 274, 300, 307, 321, 328, 331, 346, 347

These instances have been selected to ensure diversity, representativeness, and randomness, while avoiding any instances that have already been labeled.
