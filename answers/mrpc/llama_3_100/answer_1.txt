To select the instances to label, I'll follow a step-by-step approach:

Random sampling: I'll randomly select 20 instances from the dataset to ensure diversity and minimize bias.
Instance coverage: I'll analyze the random sample and identify instances that cover a wide range of sentence structures, lengths, and topics.
Error analysis: I'll simulate a machine learning model on the random sample and identify instances where the model is likely to make errors or require clarification.
Uncertainty sampling: I'll select instances that the model is uncertain about, characterized by low confidence scores or conflicting predictions.
Diversity sampling: I'll choose instances that exhibit diverse linguistic features, such as varying verb tenses, sentence lengths, or grammatical structures.
After applying these strategies, I've selected the following 32 instances for labeling:

1, 4, 7, 11, 15, 18, 21, 24, 26, 28, 31, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 59, 62, 65, 68, 71, 73, 76, 79, 82, 85, 88, 91

These instances should provide a diverse and representative set for labeling, helping to improve the performance of a machine learning model on this dataset.
