To select the most informative instances for labeling by a human annotator, I would employ a strategy that aims to choose a diverse and representative sample of the dataset. This approach would help in training a more accurate and generalizable model. The steps would be:

1. **Diversity in Topics:** Ensure instances cover a wide range of topics. This avoids bias towards any specific subject.

2. **Variability in Sentence Structure:** Choose sentences with different structures and lengths to help the model learn various syntactic patterns.

3. **Inclusion of Challenging Cases:** Select instances where sentences are either very similar or quite different, to challenge the model's understanding of nuances in language.

4. **Balanced Representations:** Ensure all types of instances (simple, complex, ambiguous, etc.) are represented.

Based on these criteria, I would select instances that cover various topics (e.g., business, health, technology, world events), exhibit different sentence structures, and include both clear and ambiguous cases.

Given the dataset, my selection for labeling would be: 
0, 2, 4, 7, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 28, 31, 36, 40, 43, 47, 51, 55, 59, 62, 67, 72, 75, 79, 83, 87, 91, 96, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120.
