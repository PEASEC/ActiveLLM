To select the 32 instances for annotation, I will apply the following steps:

1. **Diversity and Coverage**: Ensure that the selected instances cover a wide range of possible sentence structures and semantic content. This will help the model to generalize better from a small annotated set.
2. **Uncertainty Sampling**: Choose instances that are likely to be uncertain or ambiguous, as these will provide the most informative labels for the model. This can be simulated by identifying instances where the sentences are very similar but with subtle differences that require careful human judgment.
3. **Class Balance**: Ensure that the instances represent a balanced set of the classes or types of annotations required (e.g., similarity, entailment, contradiction).

Based on the given instances, here are the 32 instances selected for annotation:

1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37, 39, 40
