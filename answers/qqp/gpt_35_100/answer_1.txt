To select the instances to label, I would aim for diversity in topics and clarity of questions, prioritizing those that seem ambiguous or challenging to understand. I would also consider instances that cover a range of interests and potentially require domain-specific knowledge. Here's a selection of 32 instances:

1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63

These instances cover various topics, including technology, relationships, education, entertainment, health, and more, ensuring a broad spectrum for annotation.
