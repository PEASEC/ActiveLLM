To select the 32 instances for labeling, I will use the following criteria:

1. **Ambiguity**: Instances that seem ambiguous or confusing, which might require a human annotator's judgment.
2. **Incorrect Information**: Instances that have clear factual inaccuracies.
3. **Complexity**: Instances that involve multiple pieces of information or entities which might be difficult for automated systems to correctly label.
4. **Contradictions**: Instances where the two sentences contradict each other.
5. **Relevance**: Instances that provide relevant information that could help improve the model's understanding.

Based on these criteria, here are the 32 selected instances:

1. 0
2. 1
3. 2
4. 3
5. 4
6. 5
7. 6
8. 8
9. 9
10. 11
11. 12
12. 14
13. 16
14. 17
15. 18
16. 19
17. 24
18. 25
19. 26
20. 27
21. 29
22. 31

26. 35
27. 37
28. 39
29. 41
30. 44
31. 47
32. 49

So the output list is:
