To select the 13 instances for detailed analysis, I would first identify those that potentially involve co-reference and, among those, choose a spread of examples, e.g.,

I wonder what Bill kissed.
I divulged when Bill promised to call me.
John believes Kim not to leave here.
I consider John the best candidate.
I believe that he left.
John believes Bill to have cooked the rice.
I wanted him to leave.
I saw only the student.
I saw the physics student.
I consider John the best candidate.
I consider John the best candidate.
I consider John the best candidate.
I divided the cake equally between us.
I would analyze these instances in detail to establish the structures and relationships involved and to compare them with each other and with other instances in the corpus.

Can you give me the list of indices of the 32 instances?
