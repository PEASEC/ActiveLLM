To select the most informative instances for labeling in an active learning context, I would follow these steps:

1. **Diversity and Representativeness**: Choose instances that represent the diverse range of data in the dataset. This means selecting samples that vary in tone, subject matter, and style.

2. **Uncertainty Sampling**: Prioritize instances where the model's current performance is uncertain. This often involves selecting samples that the model is least confident about.

3. **Stratified Sampling**: Ensure that all categories or themes present in the dataset are represented in the selected instances.

4. **Avoid Redundancy**: Avoid selecting instances that are very similar to each other to ensure a wide coverage of different types of data.

5. **Balance**: If there are known imbalances in the dataset, select instances that help in balancing these out, ensuring that underrepresented data types are adequately sampled.

Based on these criteria and the given instances, I would select a mix of instances that represent different sentiments, themes, and styles. This selection aims to cover a broad range of data types and ensure that the model learns from a representative and diverse set of instances.

Selected Instances for Labeling: 
0, 3, 6, 10, 14, 17, 21, 27, 31, 36, 42, 47, 52, 58, 64, 69, 73, 77, 83, 88, 93, 99, 105, 111, 117, 122, 128, 134, 141, 147, 153, 159

This selection includes a variety of sentiments (positive, negative, neutral), different themes (comedy, drama, action, etc.), and varied styles of expression. This should provide a comprehensive set of data points for the annotator to label, which will be valuable for training a well-rounded model.
