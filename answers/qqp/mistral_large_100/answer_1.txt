To select the instances to label, I would follow these steps:

1. **Diversity**: Ensure the selected instances cover a wide range of topics. This will help the model learn about various types of questions and improve its overall performance.

2. **Uncertainty**: Choose instances that seem to have some level of uncertainty or ambiguity. These instances can provide valuable learning opportunities for the model.

3. **Representativeness**: Select instances that seem to be representative of the overall dataset. This will help ensure the model is learning from typical examples.

Based on these criteria, here are the instances I would select:

0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 3, 7, 11, 19, 23, 29, 37, 41, 49, 53, 59, 67.

These instances cover a wide range of topics, include some ambiguous questions, and seem to be representative of the overall dataset.
