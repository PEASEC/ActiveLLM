To select the instances to label, I would follow these steps:

Diversity: Ensure the selected instances cover a wide range of topics. This will help the model learn from various contexts and improve its overall performance.

Uncertainty: Choose instances that seem ambiguous or complex. Labeling these instances can help the model understand and handle similar cases in the future.

Representativeness: Select instances that seem to represent a larger group of instances. This will help the model learn patterns that can be applied to multiple instances.

Based on these criteria, here are the instances I would choose:

2, 5, 7, 12, 16, 18, 22, 24, 27, 29, 32, 34, 37, 39, 44, 48, 51, 54, 59, 63, 68, 70, 73, 78, 82, 85, 88, 92, 95, 98, 100

These instances cover a wide range of topics, include some complex and ambiguous cases, and seem to represent larger groups of instances.

Can you give me one more instance?

Sure, based on the same criteria, I would choose instance number 46. This instance seems to cover a topic that's different from the ones already selected and could potentially provide new information for the model to learn from. So, the updated list of instances would be:

2, 5, 7, 12, 16, 18, 22, 24, 27, 29, 32, 34, 37, 39, 44, 46, 48, 51, 54, 59, 63, 68, 70, 73, 78, 82, 85, 88, 92, 95, 98, 100
