muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner .

the film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma , but what makes it transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years . 
 ##### 
smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds . 
 ##### 
is n't much fun . 
 ##### 
jolie gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters , especially if you 're in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging . 
 #####

the film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either does n't notice when his story ends or just ca n't tear himself away from the characters -- but

the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of gator-bashing are consistently delightful .

forces us to consider the unthinkable , the unacceptable , the unmentionable 
 ##### 
creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters

a freaky bit of art that 's there to scare while we delight in the images

not only better than its predecessor

that 's enough to sustain laughs

's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey

, it actually hurts to watch . 
 ##### 
enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded 
 ##### 
is a cinematic car wreck , a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride

it will just as likely make you weep , and it will do so in a way that does n't make you feel like a sucker .

pseudo-philosophic

is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work

once amusing

that frenetic spectacle ( on the tv show )

good film 
 ##### 
one of the most interesting writer/directors working today 
 ##### 
rock solid family fun out of the gates , extremely imaginative through out , but wanes in the middle 
 ##### 
it 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
 ##### 
destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country . 
 ##### 
does an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and 
 ##### 
this is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences ... and 
 ##### 
the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films 
 ##### 
feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas . 
 ##### 
an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention 
 ##### 
clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes .

thriller as lazy

to a night in the living room than a night at the movies

is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
 ##### 
consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable

than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run 
 ##### 
hedonistic 
 ##### 
a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically 
 ##### 
working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by gianni romoli ... ozpetek avoids most of the pitfalls you 'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up 
 ##### 
the unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing kaufman has carved from orleans ' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality . 
 ##### 
more than merely a holocaust movie 
 ##### 
that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right 
 ##### 
of the killing field and the barbarism of ` ethnic cleansing 
 ##### 
unknowable 
 ##### 
we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies . 
 ##### 
miraculous as its dreamworks makers 
 ##### 
'll want to crawl up your own *** in embarrassment 
 ##### 
a wild ride of a movie that keeps throwing fastballs 
 ##### 
it 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence . 
 ##### 
this ready-made midnight movie probably wo n't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it 's goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun 
 ##### 
is a relationship that is worthy of our respect 
 ##### 
mainly because blanchett and ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters ' suffering 
 ##### 
plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air 
 ##### 
is a rambling examination of american gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition 
 ##### 
an incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief 
 ##### 
has fun with the quirks of family life 
 ##### 
the emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task .

stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric

de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors

to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once 
 ##### 
amused by its special effects 
 ##### 
there are n't many conclusive answers in the film , but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs. the big guys . 
 ##### 
an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something 
 ##### 
aimless , arduous , and 
 ##### 
oddly compelling 
 ##### 
's a reason the studio did n't offer an advance screening 
 ##### 
bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer 's most pleasurable movies 
 ##### 
unfolds as one of the most politically audacious films of recent decades 
 ##### 
tom green 's freddie got fingered 
 ##### 
high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd . 
 ##### 
it 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . 
 ##### 
supplies with tremendous skill 
 ##### 
's great for the kids 
 ##### 
takes a potentially trite and overused concept ( aliens come to earth ) and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion . 
 ##### 
maintains an appealing veneer without becoming too cute about it . 
 ##### 
plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp . 
 ##### 
leaves little doubt that kidman has become one of our best actors 
 ##### 
a compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day 
 ##### 
comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness . 
 ##### 
though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should . 
 ##### 
a fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor , sensuality , and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys . 
 ##### 
a determined woman 's courage to find her husband in a war zone 
 ##### 
an improvement on the first blade

and the positive change in tone here seems to have recharged him . 
 ##### 
parents beware ; 
 ##### 
impossible to claim that it is `` based on a true story '' 
 ##### 
languishing 
 ##### 
has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product 
 ##### 
work as well as a remarkably faithful one
