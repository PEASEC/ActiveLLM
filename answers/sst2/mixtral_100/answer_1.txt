To select the instances to label, I would follow these steps:

Identify diverse examples: I would choose instances that showcase a variety of aspects, sentiments, and structures to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.
Balance positive and negative sentiments: I would select an equal number of positive and negative instances to provide a balanced view of the dataset.
Select both short and long instances: I would include both brief and extensive instances to capture a range of expression styles.
Ensure diversity in the topics: I would select instances that cover various subjects and domains to capture a wide range of contexts.
Based on these criteria, I would label the following instances:

0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, 22, 23, 25, 29, 31, 34, 37, 39, 42, 45, 48, 52, 55, 57, 61, 64, 67, 71, 74, 77, 80, 85, 88, 97

These instances were chosen to represent various aspects of the dataset and help the annotator understand its complexity and diversity.
