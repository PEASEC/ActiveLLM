To select the most relevant instances for labeling, I will apply the guidelines to the given dataset. I will focus on identifying tweets that contain specific information relevant to cybersecurity experts, such as details about vulnerabilities, methods of exploitation, mitigation, proof of concepts, code, fixes, IOCs, malware names, exploits, or CVE IDs. Conversely, I will exclude tweets that are too general, speculative, politically motivated, aimed at the general public, or those that are spam.

Considering these guidelines, here are the instances I would choose to label:

1, 2, 8, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25, 30, 31, 32, 35, 44, 46, 48, 49, 50, 57, 58, 62, 68, 70, 76, 84, 90, 91, 94, 101, 104, 105, 111, 114, 115, 117, 119, 120, 125, 126, 135, 136, 139, 140, 142, 147, 149, 150, 155, 156, 158, 159, 160, 163, 164, 166, 167, 168, 172, 173, 174, 176, 177, 181, 182, 183, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 202, 204, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 227, 228, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300.
