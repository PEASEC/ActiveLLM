To select 30 instances for the active learner to analyze, I would suggest focusing on diverse, interesting, and thought-provoking instances that showcase various aspects of language, culture, and meaning. Here are 30 instances that meet those criteria:

The sulking, moody male hustler (WO N'T BE AN) EXCEEDINGLY memorable one for most people.
Makes time go faster rather than the other way around.
It still has n't a trace of humanity or empathy.
I'm beginning to hate it halfway through this picture.
A noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code.
Lush, all-enveloping movie experience.
The unacceptable, the unthinkable, the unmentionable.
Sprightly spin.
A pathetic, endearing hero.
A little peculiar, but this is one that should be thrown back in the river.
The story is bogus.
Here's a fun one.
The biggest problem with Roger Avary's uproar against the MPA.
One of the funniest jokes.
A likable movie, but not more accomplished.
Less than half the plot and ingenuity.
Wildly overproduced, inadequately motivated every step of the way.
Suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis.
The same exact movie a hundred times.
The murder.
The funniest jokes.
The film has not a trace of humanity or empathy.
To warm the hearts of animation enthusiasts of all ages.
Quite entertaining.
The film runs on a little longer than it needs to.
However, it's a rushed, slapdash, sequel-for-the-sake-of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity.
However, it's a first-rate cast.
Assuming the bar of expectations has n't been raised above sixth-grade height.
Very original.
Far more successful.
These instances offer a range of linguistic, conceptual, and cultural features to analyze and discuss, making them valuable for active learning and comprehension.

Can you give me the list of the 32 indeces of the instances you would label?

Sure, here are two more instances that I believe would be valuable for the active learner to analyze and label:

67: This instance offers a strong emotional reaction to the film, which could be interesting to analyze in terms of the viewer's engagement with the movie.
97: This instance highlights the importance of humor and entertainment in films, which could be a useful point of comparison with other instances that focus on different aspects of cinematic experience.
These instances, when added to the previous list of 30, will provide a diverse and engaging set of examples for the active learner to analyze and label. Here are the updated indices for the full list of 32 instances:
