To select the instances to label, I would follow these steps:

1. **Diversity**: Ensure the selected instances cover a wide range of sentiments and topics. This will help the model learn to handle different types of data.

2. **Uncertainty**: Choose instances that seem to have conflicting or ambiguous sentiments. These instances can provide valuable learning opportunities for the model.

3. **Representativeness**: Select instances that seem to represent common patterns or themes in the data. This will help the model learn to recognize and handle these patterns.

Based on these criteria, here are the instances I would select:

1, 5, 9, 12, 15, 18, 23, 26, 29, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70, 73, 76, 79, 82, 85, 88, 91, 94, 97, 100

These instances cover a wide range of sentiments, from positive to negative, and include some that are more ambiguous or complex. They also cover a variety of topics and seem to represent common patterns in the data.
