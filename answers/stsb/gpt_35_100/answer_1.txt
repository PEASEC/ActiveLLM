To select the 32 instances to label, I would aim for diversity in the content of the sentences, covering various topics, linguistic structures, and lengths. Additionally, I would prioritize instances where the meaning or context may not be immediately clear or where there is potential ambiguity. Here's the list of instances I would choose:

1, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12, 16, 18, 21, 24, 26, 30, 33, 35, 38, 41, 44, 46, 49, 51, 53, 55, 58, 61, 63, 66, 69, 72, 76, 79, 82, 87.

These instances cover a wide range of topics and linguistic structures, and they include instances with potential ambiguity or unclear context that could benefit from human annotation.
