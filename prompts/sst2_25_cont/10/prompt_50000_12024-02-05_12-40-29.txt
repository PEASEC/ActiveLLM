muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner .

the film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma , but what makes it transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years . 
 ##### 
smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds .

jolie gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters , especially if you 're in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging .

the film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either does n't notice when his story ends or just ca n't tear himself away from the characters -- but

the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of gator-bashing are consistently delightful .

 ##### 
creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters

a freaky bit of art that 's there to scare while we delight in the images

not only better than its predecessor

enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded 
 ##### 
is a cinematic car wreck , a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride

it will just as likely make you weep , and it will do so in a way that does n't make you feel like a sucker .

godard 's ode to tackling life 's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ... in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that 's unfocused and tediously exasperating .

look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar

it 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .

pseudo-philosophic

is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work

once amusing

that frenetic spectacle ( on the tv show )

for the most part , the film is deadly dull

good film 
 ##### 
one of the most interesting writer/directors working today 
 ##### 
rock solid family fun out of the gates , extremely imaginative through out , but wanes in the middle 
 ##### 
it 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
 ##### 
destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country . 
 ##### 
does an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and 
 ##### 
this is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences ... and 
 ##### 
the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films 
 ##### 
feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .

an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention 
 ##### 
clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes .

thriller as lazy

is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .

consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable 
 ##### 
than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run 
 ##### 
hedonistic 
 ##### 
a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically 
 ##### 
working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by gianni romoli ... ozpetek avoids most of the pitfalls you 'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up 
 ##### 
the unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing kaufman has carved from orleans ' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality . 
 ##### 
more than merely a holocaust movie

that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right

we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies .

miraculous as its dreamworks makers 
 ##### 
'll want to crawl up your own *** in embarrassment 
 ##### 
a wild ride of a movie that keeps throwing fastballs 
 ##### 
it 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence . 
 ##### 
this ready-made midnight movie probably wo n't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it 's goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun 
 ##### 
is a relationship that is worthy of our respect 
 ##### 
mainly because blanchett and ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters ' suffering 
 ##### 
plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air 
 ##### 
is a rambling examination of american gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition 
 ##### 
an incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief 
 ##### 
has fun with the quirks of family life 
 ##### 
the emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task .

stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric

de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors

tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving

to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once 
 ##### 
amused by its special effects 
 ##### 
there are n't many conclusive answers in the film , but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs. the big guys . 
 ##### 
an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something 
 ##### 
aimless , arduous , and 
 ##### 
oddly compelling 
 ##### 
's a reason the studio did n't offer an advance screening 
 ##### 
bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer 's most pleasurable movies 
 #####

 ##### 
tom green 's freddie got fingered 
 ##### 
high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd . 
 ##### 
it 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . 
 ##### 
supplies with tremendous skill 
 ##### 
's great for the kids 
 ##### 
takes a potentially trite and overused concept ( aliens come to earth ) and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion . 
 ##### 
maintains an appealing veneer without becoming too cute about it . 
 ##### 
plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp . 
 ##### 
leaves little doubt that kidman has become one of our best actors 
 ##### 
a compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day 
 ##### 
comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness . 
 ##### 
though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should . 
 ##### 
a fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor , sensuality , and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys . 
 ##### 
a determined woman 's courage to find her husband in a war zone 
 ##### 
an improvement on the first blade

parents beware ;

impossible to claim that it is `` based on a true story ''

languishing

 ##### 
a deeper story 
 ##### 
such conviction 
 ##### 
i liked it because it was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive . 
 ##### 
can enjoy much of jonah simply , and gratefully , as laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor . 
 ##### 
a culture-clash comedy that , in addition to being very funny , 
 ##### 
bundling the flowers of perversity , comedy and romance into a strangely tempting bouquet of a movie 
 ##### 
is richly detailed , deftly executed and utterly absorbing . 
 ##### 
a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism . 
 ##### 
what 's so striking about jolie 's performance is that she never lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair . 
 ##### 
not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time . 
 ##### 
perfectly creepy and believable 
 ##### 
an intriguing look at the french film industry during the german occupation 
 ##### 
a meditation on faith and madness 
 ##### 
bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i have n't encountered since at least pete 's dragon . 
 ##### 
a memorable directorial debut 
 ##### 
i do n't know if frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he 's made at least one damn fine horror movie 
 ##### 
's enough cool fun here to warm the hearts of animation enthusiasts of all ages 
 ##### 
puts a human face on derrida , and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible 
 ##### 
's about issues most adults have to face in marriage 
 ##### 
powerful and astonishingly vivid 
 ##### 
the most brilliant work in this genre since the 1984 uncut version of sergio leone 's flawed but staggering once upon a time in america . 
 ##### 
shiri is an action film that delivers on the promise of excitement , but it also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience . 
 ##### 
there 's none of the happily-ever - after spangle of monsoon wedding in late marriage -- and that 's part of what makes dover kosashvili 's outstanding feature debut so potent . 
 ##### 
also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl 
 ##### 
is the best little `` horror '' movie i 've seen in years 
 ##### 
the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics 
 ##### 
like a glossy rehash 
 ##### 
horribly depressing and 
 ##### 
touching drama 
 ##### 
a bilingual charmer 
 ##### 
, we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it 's hard to stop watching . 
 ##### 
such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us `` the skulls '' and last year 's `` rollerball . '' 
 ##### 
a fantastically vital movie 
 ##### 
engrossing 
 ##### 
of emotionally and narratively complex filmmaking

a fascinating case study of flower-power liberation -- and 
 ##### 
viewers out in the cold

bland animated sequel

caruso sometimes descends into sub-tarantino cuteness ... but for the most part he makes sure the salton sea works the way a good noir should , keeping it tight and nasty . 
 ##### 
offensive and 
 ##### 
solid , satisfying fare for adults 
 ##### 
that make it well worth watching 
 ##### 
's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre . 
 ##### 
of the band 
 ##### 
pack your knitting needles . 
 ##### 
a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title 
 ##### 
rooted in a sincere performance 
 ##### 
taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history 
 ##### 
the crazy things that keep people going in this crazy life 
 ##### 
fiercely clever and subtle film 
 ##### 
brutal and funny 
 ##### 
is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost . 
 ##### 
the chatter of parrots raised on oprah 
 ##### 
it 's tough to watch , but it 's a fantastic movie 
 ##### 
madonna has made herself over so often now , there 's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson 's nose . 
 ##### 
the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting 
 ##### 
exceptional thriller 
 ##### 
bloodwork is n't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery . 
 ##### 
never rise above the level of an after-school tv special 
 ##### 
just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective . 
 ##### 
spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects of ` black culture ' and the dorkier aspects of ` white culture , ' even as it points out how inseparable the two are . 
 ##### 
snide 
 ##### 
the film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences . 
 ##### 
fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller 
 ##### 
-- conrad l. hall 's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there 's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 
 ##### 
the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack 
 ##### 
everything kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art 
 ##### 
the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it 's offensive , but that it 's boring . 
 ##### 
is funny , charming and quirky 
 ##### 
point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover 
 #####

 ##### 
daringly perceptive , taut , piercing and feisty , biggie and tupac is undeniably subversive and involving in its bold presentation .

the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of ` ethnic cleansing 
 ##### 
an energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching ( or turntablism ) in particular .
