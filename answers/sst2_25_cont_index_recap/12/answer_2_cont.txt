To select 25 instances for labeling, I would follow a strategy that aims to maximize the diversity and informativeness of the selected instances. This approach can help improve the performance of a machine learning model trained on this data by ensuring it learns from a wide range of examples. Here's a step-by-step plan:

Diversity in Sentiment: Ensure a balanced representation of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments to help the model generalize well across different types of sentiment.
Variability in Length and Complexity: Choose instances with varying lengths and complexities. This includes short, straightforward examples and longer, more nuanced ones.
Representation of Different Themes: Select instances that cover a variety of themes or subjects to ensure broad coverage of the dataset's domain.
Inclusion of Ambiguous Cases: Include instances that may be ambiguous or have a mix of positive and negative sentiments. These can be particularly informative for training.
Avoid Redundancy: Avoid selecting instances that are too similar to those already labeled or to each other to ensure the new labels add unique value to the dataset.
Given these criteria and the instances provided, I'll select a mix of instances that seem to offer a diverse range of sentiments, topics, and complexities, while ensuring they are different from the already labeled ones:

Positive Sentiments: 14, 33, 44, 56, 69, 80, 94, 100, 112, 116, 123, 132, 140, 167, 179, 195
Negative Sentiments: 3, 12, 34, 49, 73, 82, 104, 119, 130, 150, 162, 189, 206, 210, 238
Neutral/Ambiguous/Complex: 8, 17, 27, 36, 58, 64, 76, 85, 98, 107
This selection aims to cover a broad spectrum of sentiments, lengths, and complexities while avoiding redundancy with already labeled instances.
