To select the best instances for labeling in an active learning context, it's crucial to pick examples that will provide the most informative feedback to the model. Hereâ€™s how I would approach the problem:

1. **Understand the task and the data**: The dataset consists of pairs of sentences where the first sentence describes a context or event and the second sentence seems to provide a summary or a key fact about the first. Our goal is to choose sentences that will help improve the understanding and performance of a model on this specific task.

2. **Diversity in Selection**: Aim to select instances from a variety of topics, ensuring that different subjects, styles, and complexities are covered. This helps the model generalize better across different types of data.

3. **Complexity and Ambiguity**: Choose sentences that involve complex interactions or those that may include ambiguities. These instances are likely to be more challenging for the model and thus more informative when labeled.

4. **Representativeness**: Include instances that are representative of common or recurring themes within the dataset. This helps in improving the model's performance on more frequently occurring data.

5. **Errors and Challenges**: Focus on instances where the model is likely to make mistakes, such as sentences with indirect references, nuanced language, or those that require a deeper understanding of context.

Given the provided dataset snippets and the indices of already labeled instances, I'll identify 25 additional instances that seem to meet the above criteria. These will be selected based on the potential complexity, representativeness, and learning value they offer to the model:

4, 7, 13, 15, 18, 19, 21, 22, 26, 28, 29, 31, 33, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.

These instances are chosen to provide a mix of complex information relationships, potential model errors, and diverse content themes, ensuring a broad and effective learning process.
