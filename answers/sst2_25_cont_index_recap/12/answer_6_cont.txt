To select the most informative instances for labeling in an active learning context, we should prioritize diversity and informativeness to improve the learning model's performance. Here's a step-by-step approach to how I would select the instances:

1. **Diversity**: Choose instances from a variety of sentiment expressions (positive, negative, neutral) to ensure the model can learn from a broad spectrum of inputs.

2. **Informativeness**: Select instances that are likely to be boundary cases or ones that are hard to classify based on the already labeled instances. These are typically more informative for the model.

3. **Representation**: Ensure that the selected instances cover different subjects, styles, and lengths to avoid bias towards a particular type of text.

Given these considerations and the constraint of choosing only 25 instances, I would focus on selecting examples that appear to offer a range of sentiments, are potentially ambiguous, and could help in refining the decision boundaries of a classification model.

Considering the need to cover a broad range of expressions and the details of the instances provided, my selection would aim to balance across different sentiments and topics, picking instances that seem to represent unique or nuanced expressions that could challenge or benefit a learning model the most.

Let's proceed with the selection:

- **Complex Sentiments**: Instances that express nuanced or mixed sentiments could be particularly informative. For example, instances expressing sarcasm, subtle praise, or criticism.
- **Diverse Subjects**: Choosing instances that cover a variety of subjects to ensure the model isn't biased towards specific topics.
- **Unique Expressions**: Instances with unique or less common expressions that could help the model learn finer nuances.

Given these guidelines, I'll select a mix of instances that seem to represent these qualities.

Let's select the instances now.

Based on the criteria of diversity, informativeness, and representation, and ensuring we do not select instances that have already been labeled, the following instances would be selected for labeling: 68, 71, 75, 81, 87, 96, 99, 101, 102, 105, 106, 110, 113, 114, 116, 119, 120, 122, 124, 125, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131.

These instances were chosen to provide a broad range of sentiments, topics, and expressions, aiming to enhance the model's learning from varied and potentially challenging texts.
