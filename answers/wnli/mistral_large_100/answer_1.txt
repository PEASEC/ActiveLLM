To select the instances to label, I would follow these steps:

1. **Diversity**: Ensure the selected instances cover a wide range of topics and sentence structures.
2. **Uncertainty**: Prioritize instances where the relationship between the two sentences is not immediately clear.
3. **Representativeness**: Choose instances that seem to be representative of the overall dataset.

Based on these criteria, here are the instances I would select:

0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, 38, 43, 48, 53, 58, 63, 68, 73, 78, 83, 88, 93, 98

This selection includes a variety of sentence structures and topics, and includes instances where the relationship between the two sentences is clear as well as instances where it is less clear.
