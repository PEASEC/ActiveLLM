To select the most valuable instances for labeling in an active learning scenario, I would consider a few key criteria:

1. **Diversity of Topics**: Choose instances that cover a wide range of topics. This ensures that the model trained with these instances can handle a variety of subjects.
2. **Difficulty or Ambiguity**: Instances that are more challenging or have ambiguous answers are often more informative for training. 
3. **Relevance and Recency**: Instances that are more relevant to current events or recent trends can be more valuable.
4. **Quality of Questions**: Prefer instances with well-formed, clear questions. This helps in building a model that understands and responds to high-quality queries.
5. **Balanced Representation**: Ensure that different types of questions (factual, opinion-based, hypothetical, etc.) are included.

Based on these criteria, I would select instances that represent a mix of topics, include some difficult or ambiguous questions, and ensure a balance in the types of questions. Here are my selections:

0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19, 21, 23, 26, 27, 30, 33, 35, 38, 40, 43, 46, 49, 51, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70, 73, 76

This selection includes a mix of technical, scientific, cultural, and opinion-based questions, as well as some that are current or have a level of ambiguity, making them good candidates for an active learning scenario.
