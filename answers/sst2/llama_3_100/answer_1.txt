What a fascinating task!

To select the 32 instances to label, I'll follow a step-by-step approach:

Diversity of sentiments: I'll aim to select instances that cover a wide range of sentiments, including positive, negative, and neutral opinions.
Variety of topics: I'll choose instances that discuss different aspects of movies, such as plot, characters, direction, cinematography, and overall entertainment value.
Language diversity: I'll select instances with diverse language styles, including formal, informal, sarcastic, and humorous tones.
Representative instances: I'll choose instances that are representative of the dataset, including both short and long sentences, and instances with different grammatical structures.
Uncertainty and ambiguity: I'll select a few instances that are ambiguous or open to interpretation, to ensure the annotator's labeling is thorough and thoughtful.
With these criteria in mind, here are the 32 instances I would label:

1, 4, 5, 12, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 31, 34, 36, 40, 44, 46, 51, 53, 55, 58, 61, 63, 65, 67, 71, 73, 76, 81, 84, 87, 90, 92, 95, 98, 100

Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on my selection process or provide any further assistance!
