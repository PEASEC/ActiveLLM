Here's a breakdown of how I would approach this active learning task, along with specific instances I would choose for labeling:

Understanding the Goal

Clarify the type of labeling: Determine the precise labeling task. Is it identifying coreferences (like pronouns and their referents), semantic roles, syntactic dependencies, or something else?
Labeling criteria: Establish the guidelines for labeling. What are the categories or relationships that the annotator needs to identify?
Active Learning Strategy

Here's an approach I would recommend, which focuses on ambiguity and model uncertainty:

Initial Model: If possible, train a base model on a small, existing dataset, or use a pre-trained model, if relevant to the task.
Uncertainty Sampling: Use this model to predict on the unlabeled instances. Select instances where the model has the lowest confidence scores. These indicate potential ambiguity or areas the model struggles with.
Focus on Diversity: Within the uncertain instances, ensure a variety in sentence structures, lengths, and vocabulary. This promotes a balanced dataset.
Iteration: Get these instances labeled, add them to the training data, retrain the model, and repeat the process.
Choosing Instances

Without concrete task details, I'll focus on potential ambiguity based on pronouns, coreference, and complex sentence structures. Here's my shortlist, aiming for around 32:

Pronoun Ambiguity:
4, 11, 19, 21, 31, 50, 59, 62, 72
Complex Coreference:
8, 9, 14, 32, 52, 75, 98
Sentence Structure:
37, 44, 61, 67, 73, 76, 80, 86, 92
Additional (If more needed):
12, 33, 54, 79
Justification

Ambiguity: Selected sentences often have unclear pronoun references (who is "he", "she", "it" referring to?). This is crucial for training a model to understand language structure.
Complex Relationships: Longer, layered sentences offer complex coreference chains that challenge an NLP model.
Diversity: The selection includes varied sentence lengths and structures for the model to learn from.
Important Considerations

Task Requirements: The type of labeling would greatly influence this selection.
Model Type: My focus assumes it's a model for tasks like coreference resolution. Adjustments are needed for other tasks.
Output

Here's the list of instance IDs as the final output:

4, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 19, 21, 31, 32, 33, 37, 44, 50, 52, 54, 59, 61, 62, 67, 72, 73, 75, 76, 79, 80, 86, 92, 98

Let me know if you have a specific labeling task in mind, and I can refine the approach and the selection of instances!

Can you give me three more?

Absolutely!  Here are three additional instances. I maintained a focus on ambiguity and complexity for these additions:

13: When Tatyana reached the cabin, her mother was sleeping. She was careful not to disturb her, undressing and climbing back into her berth.  (Complex coreference and pronoun resolution)

47: I sat there feeling rather like a chappie I'd once read about in a book, who murdered another cove and hid the body under the dining-room table, and then had to be the life and soul of a dinner party, with it there all the time. (Nested references, difficult to pinpoint who "it" refers to)

68: Grant worked hard to harvest his beans so he and his family would have enough to eat that winter, His friend Henry let him stack them in his barn where they would dry. Later, he and Tatyana would shell them and cook them for their Sunday dinners. (Ambiguous pronoun use,  and complex relationships between people)

Let me know if you have a specific requirement in mind, and I can tailor the selections further!
