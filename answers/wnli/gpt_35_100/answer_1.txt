To select the instances for labeling, I would aim for diversity across various aspects such as syntactic structures, semantic relationships, and pronoun references. I would prioritize instances where there may be ambiguity or complexity in understanding the relationship between the two sentences. Here's the selection of 32 instances:

5, 8, 11, 12, 17, 22, 24, 27, 31, 36, 39, 41, 43, 47, 49, 52, 57, 59, 63, 69, 71, 73, 76, 79, 82, 85, 89, 91, 92, 95, 97, 100
