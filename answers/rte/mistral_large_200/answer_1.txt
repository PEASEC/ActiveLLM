To select the instances to label, I would first perform a stratified sampling of the dataset to ensure that the selected instances are representative of the entire dataset. Then, I would use an uncertainty sampling strategy to select the instances that the model is least confident about. This would help the model to learn from its mistakes and improve its performance on the task. Finally, I would also use a diversity sampling strategy to select instances that are diverse and cover different parts of the input space. This would help the model to generalize better to unseen data.

Based on these strategies, the instances that I would select for labeling are: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 25, 27, 30, 32, 35, 37, 40, 42, 45, 47, 50, 52, 55, 57, 60, 62, 65, 67, 70, 72, 75, 77.
