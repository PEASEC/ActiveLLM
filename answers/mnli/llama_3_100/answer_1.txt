After careful consideration, I have selected the following 32 instances to label:

1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 18, 22, 23, 25, 27, 29, 32, 35, 37, 40, 42, 45, 48, 51, 52, 55, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 71, 74, 76, 80, 82, 86, 92

These instances were chosen based on factors such as:

Diversity of topics and domains
Representativeness of different linguistic styles and genres
Presence of ambiguous or uncertain language
Potential for disagreements in interpretation or labeling
Opportunities for active learning and feedback
By labeling these instances, the annotator will be able to provide a diverse and informative set of examples that will help me improve my performance and better understand the nuances of natural language.
