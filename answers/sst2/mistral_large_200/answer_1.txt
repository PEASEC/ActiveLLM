To select the instances to label, I would follow these steps:

1. **Diversity**: Ensure the selected instances cover a wide range of sentiments and topics. This will help the model learn to handle different types of data.

2. **Uncertainty**: Choose instances that seem to have conflicting sentiments or are difficult to classify. These instances can provide valuable learning opportunities for the model.

3. **Representativeness**: Select instances that seem to represent common patterns or sentiments in the data. This will help the model learn to recognize these patterns.

Based on these criteria, here are the instances I would select:

4, 5, 12, 15, 19, 23, 26, 31, 34, 35, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 61, 65, 67, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99, 102, 105

These instances seem to cover a wide range of sentiments and topics, include some that are difficult to classify, and represent common patterns in the data.
